2555131	Christian	Westerman	6	75	298	11.875	Westerman was a top national recruit who attended Auburn for his first two years, losing most of his redshirt freshman season due to injury before deciding to return to his home state of Arizona to finish his career. He excelled last fall in his first season as a starter for the Sun Devils, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice for his stout play and mobility at left guard. Westerman's play his senior campaign did not disappoint, as his attitude, stoutness, mobility, and solid technique made him a second-team all-conference performer.	Outstanding athleticism and movement skills. Is quick off the snap and able to beat defenders to the spot. Can get to difficult cross­-face blocks using timing, technique and footwork. At his best when on the move. When pulling or climbing to second level, has a terrific connect rate against moving targets in space. True technician. Plays with desired balance and base and his feet rarely stop chopping and working after contact. Approaches target with bend and rolls hips up under him after contact. Has massive bear paws for hands and is a weight ­room freak daddy. Has hand placement and upper body strength to lockout pass rushers if he gets extension first. Father was a three-year starter at guard for Arizona State. Should test off the charts at the combine.	While he moves stacks of weights with ease, his play strength doesn't always match that when matched up against interior power players. Short yardage push will not be an NFL strength. May need more mass on his frame to handle NFL defensive tackles. When asked to base block, becomes more of a stalemate blocker than block­-winner. Could use a more authoritative punch in pass protection. I question whether he can effectively re­direct interior pass rushers once they get into the edge on him.	Alex Mack	Quick-­twitch, athletic guard who comes from a football family and has been working on his strength and athleticism from a young age. Offensive line coaches will appreciate Westerman's technical savvy and zone scheme teams will covet his fluidity and blocking ability on the move. A move to center is not out of the question thanks to his body type and quickness and his draft stock may be helped by a potential ability to offer roster depth at several offensive line positions.	\N	45	5.75	christian-westerman	\N
2555132	Cody	Whitehair	6	76	301	10.125	As the Wildcats' strongest and most athletic lineman, Whitehair (6-4, 309) has been moved from right tackle to left guard, back to right tackle, and finally to left tackle for his last two seasons. His play on the blind side earned him first-team All-Big 12 honors in 2015 (following two second-team nods and an honorable mention as a freshman), as he not only possesses the footwork to hold off edge rushers but understands the angles needed to free space for running backs. His versatility and technique make him among the top linemen in the draft class.	Four-­year starter voted team captain in 2015. Tireless worker bee in the weight room and in practices who brings a high degree of dependability and consistency to the table. Team­-oriented. Played exceptionally well while out of position at left tackle for Kansas State. Atypical body composure and control. Is almost always in complete control of his body thanks to outstanding core strength and balance. Extremely efficient with his movements after the snap. Has played both guard and both tackle spots and has roster value at all five positions. Mirrors with a wide, stout base and has great feel for keeping defender squared up throughout the rep. Confident, composed and competitive. Smooth and athletic when asked to pull and has radar to find target and strike accurate blow. Makes up for shorter arms with massive hands that function as vise grips. Consistent with hand placement and extremely sticky blocker. Combines hand strength and balance to snatch and control a defender until the whistle blows. Can sink hips at contact and should be able to stalemate bigger players across from him. Exceptional body control and core strength allows him to successfully redirect defenders who get to his edge.	Arm length is below average for interior lineman. Allows longer defenders into his framework a little too often. Needs to play with slightly faster hands inside and improve the timing of his punch. May not be able to carry much more mass on his frame. Has core power but lack of length and overall girth could lead to him allowing some pocket push against bull rushers. Played from two-­point stance as tackle in college and needs to prove he can fire out of three-­point stance and generate push at the point of attack in the running game. May need additional work and reps to get timing and angles right from the guard spot. Will get caught lunging at times when playing in space.	Zack Martin	With his combination of functional strength and body control, Whitehair might be one of the safest offensive linemen in the entire draft. He will almost assuredly be bumped inside to guard, but could be considered at center as well. He has the confidence and talent to start right away and his run blocking should improve as he gets more comfortable firing out from a three-­point stance. Whitehair has the ability to be a very good starter with a ceiling that could reach the all-pro level.	\N	14	6.42999999999999972	cody-whitehair	\N
2555133	Connor	McGovern	6	76	306	10.375	One of the strongest players in college football, McGovern has broken weight room records at Mizzou (like a 690-pound squat) and actually tore his pectoral muscle trying to bench 515 pounds. The Gatorade High School Player of the Year in North Dakota in 2010, McGovern's not just all muscle. He's started for three years at right guard, right tackle, and then left tackle as a senior. Though McGovern was solid for the Tigers at tackle, scouts consider him a better interior prospect due to that strength and his underrated movement skills. He hopes to move up boards throughout the process, just like his teammate, Mitch Morse, who was picked in the mid-second round by Kansas City in the 2015 draft.	Has broad waist and possesses outstanding strength. Broke school record with six squats of 690 pounds and partially tore his pectoral muscle during one off-­season attempting to bench press 515 pounds (did not miss any games). Takes good angles up to second level on zone plays targeting the outside shoulder of the linebacker. Solid short area foot quickness and adequate athleticism. Able to make quick step inside to catch stunts and inside pass rush moves. Smooth, well-­balanced pass sets out to defensive ends. Plays with ready hands. Has potential to land heavy punch in pass protection. When he gets on top of edge rushers, understands how to crowd them and take away their options. Mindful of twists and stunts and sees "games" early.	Still a little raw in his pass sets. Relies on opening gate and chasing edge rusher up the field rather than trusting footwork. Gets a little loose with his feet on high side of the arc and might open up inside counter moves to the quarterback (as a tackle). Has shorter arms than teams desire from tackles. Will get too cute with his hands at times rather than landing a big punch and snatching his target. Top heavy, barrel-chested build. Needs to play with better bend and wider base in space. Gets caught on skates and unable to change directions quickly when forced to adjust to moving targets on second level. As a guard, must be careful not to over-commit to first block T/E twists.	Zane Beadles	Three-year starter who has played guard and both tackle spots. While he has the power and frame of a guard, there are some teams who may give him a shot at right tackle first. McGovern still has some work to do in pass protection, but shows potential to be a starter in the league. He is an ascending prospect whose stock should rise thanks to his power and multi-­position diversity.	"He has some holes in his game right now, but I think they are all correctable. I'm looking at him as a tackle because I would like to use his power and athleticism to help spring our running game outside. I love that he's played on a line with (Mitch) Morse and (Evan) Boehm. Those are two great leaders." -- Southwest area scout	15	5.37000000000000011	connor-mcgovern	\N
2555134	Dominick	Jackson	6	77	313	9.75	Jackson was one of the top junior college players in the country at the College of San Mateo in 2013, dominating his competition at the guard position on an every-play basis. Although he played as a reserve in first year with Alabama, he made the field as a blocking back in goal-line situations because of his athleticism and willingness to take on defenders in the hole. Jackson's run blocking as the Tide?s starting right tackle in 2015 lived up to the hype, and he was solid enough in pass protection as well to be named second-team All-SEC. Jackson's versatility will be valued by NFL scouts.	Has the bubble and lower leg thickness teams look for from guards. Showed improvement throughout the season. Good natural strength. Plays with desired pad level out of snap. Rarely gets pushed around by pure power. Has natural anchor to absorb a blow from downhill linebacker and maintain contact balance. Has power in trunk to build a wall when he gets his man sealed off in run game. Excels in short pull game, stalking and leveraging his second level targets. As base blocker, keeps hands inside framework of defender and looks to latch on. Shows some ability to redirect and recover rather than taking a loss when losing early in run rep. Adequate initial quickness with understanding of angles. Patient combination blocker when needed. Plays with a sturdy base and better body control than expected. Keeps head up and out of his pass sets and has the anchor and arm extension to hold up to bull rushers from guard position. Shows room for continued improvement.	At times, more of a positional blocker than drive blocker. Allows base to narrow as drive blocker. Doesn't always play to his power potential. Too content to engage and push rather than impose his will on opponent with booming impact at point of attack. As run blocker, hands can fly open a little on second level blocks. Has some hip tightness that limits his athleticism. If he's not tight with footwork and angles, he can?t win. Needs to engage with more aggression on second level. Will allow linebackers to escape his clutches. Doesn't have the feet necessary to be an NFL tackle in pass protection. Average change of direction against pass rush. Scouts question his ability to process quickly against blitzes and twists if he moves to guard. Can be lethargic with initial punch opening door for crafty pass rushers. Short arms for the position. Needs to use faster, jabbing punch. Not athletic enough to recover as pass blocker when beaten.	John Jerry	Scouts are picking holes in his game, but the tape shows a player who consistently performed his job and who improved throughout his first season as a starter. Jackson lacks the athleticism and length to play tackle and will likely have to bump down inside, but with his thick trunk, core strength and body control, Jackson should be able to come in as a backup and may be an eventual starter in the league.	\N	88	5.29999999999999982	dominick-jackson	\N
2555139	Landon	Turner	6	76	330	10.375	An absolute road grader, Turner has turned the heads of NFL general managers with his ability to move the line of scrimmage. The three-plus year starter at right guard followed up a third-team All-ACC junior campaign with an first-team Associated Press All-American and first-team all-conference senior year. The nephew of former NFL fullback Jim Braxton plays with the same tough mindset as his uncle.	Thickly built with a bulldozer for a lower body. Grown man strength with jolting power in his hands. Blows the doors off of defensive tackles that don't have meat on their bones and power to match up. Explodes with full force into his target, bench presses his victim and runs feet after contact to finish the job. Seals down blocks and can redirect gap shooters as long as he gets his hands on them. Not overly flexible, but has enough bend at the point of attack for small space, phone booth ball. Pass sets with good arm extension and adequate posture to give him his best shot at changing direction when needed. Ability to mirror shows promise for a man his size. Plays with aggression and looks to impose his will. Pass protection and overall play showed noticeable improvement from where he was in 2014.	Smashes opposition with pure power but doesn't have the bend to snap hips into blocks and secure them longer. Needs to improve his sloppy hand placement. Labors with lateral movement. Straight-legged mover in space and will be very hit or miss when asked to pull and hit targets while on the move. Predictable change of direction concerns. Sees when power step against inside move is needed, but feet don?t always cooperate. Needs combo blocks to be right in front of him or he tends to whiff on second level. Marginal reactive athleticism limits sustained blocks against active, eager defenders. Could struggle quite a bit in pass protection against speedy, sub ­package pass rushers inside.	A.J. Cann	Landon Turner is a very easy evaluation in my estimation because his strengths and weaknesses are so obvious. Turner is a road grader deluxe whose size and power will have teams who covet those traits licking their chops. However, he?s no dancing bear and they will have to be OK with his potential concerns against quickness in pass protection.	\N	7	5.65000000000000036	landon-turner	\N
2555135	Donavon	Clark	6	76	315	\N	The Spartans had one of the best offensive lines in the country in 2015, when healthy. And when injuries took out someone up front, Clark used his toughness, stout build and length to change positions. Spartan coaches plugged him in at left tackle for four games in 2013, split his time between right tackle (five games) and right guard (eight) during his junior year, and he switched back and forth between those last two positions often during his senior year. The 2015 third-team All-Big Ten coaches' pick is best inside at the next level, and he has the attributes to provide reliable backup services, if not start.	Decent quickness laterally when asked to pull and trap. Has quick second step off the snap and into his target. Showed versatility in college. Primarily started at right guard, but also had nine starts at right tackle and six starts at left tackle. Wide­ body with power to push if his contact point is good. Praised for leadership qualities. Good football IQ. Was shifted from position to position in-­game and was able to handle responsibilities. Recognizes twist looks.	High cut with issues changing direction. Plays in both running game and passing game with a base that is entirely too narrow causing him to lose balance. Leans into second level blocks with head and shoulders out over his feet. Unable to sustain blocks for very long and struggles to consistently secure blocks when asked to move. Hand placement can turn into hug placement.	\N	Wide-­bodied guard prospect who has been able to handle his business at tackle when called on, but who lacks the athleticism to play outside in the pros. Clark?s inability to sustain blocks and make the most of his power stems, in part, from a very narrow play base and that could be challenging to correct. His intelligence and toughness give him a shot at making a roster.	\N	34	4.82000000000000028	donavon-clark	\N
2555136	Joe	Dahl	6	76	304	9.125	After spending one year at the University of Montana and another sitting out as a transfer student, Dahl stepped into the starting lineup for the Cougars and hasn't left. He was the team?s left guard for the 2013 regular season before moving out to left tackle for the bowl game ?- his home for the past two seasons. It?s no surprise head coach/offensive mad genius Mike Leach can pass 50 times a game with minimal pressure given Dahl's ability to lock down the quarterback?s blind side with good lateral movement and a solid anchor. Despite earning first-team All-Pac-12 and USA Today second-team All-American accolades at left tackle in 2015, NFL scouts will want Dahl moved inside at the next level due to his average size and length. Either way, he?ll be a worthy pick as a potential starter.	Has started at guard and tackle and could be considered emergency tackle in a pinch. Decent flexibility in his lower half. Uses wide base as run blocker. Despite playing in pass-happy offense, shows ability to fire out with pop into defender and get some initial push as drive blocker. Good grip to maintain his initial block. Has hand quickness to move inside. Does a nice job of shifting weight to challenge inside moves. Coaches rave about his work habits and ability to retain information. Added weight and then muscle to his frame over last two years. Works his tail off to recover when beaten in pass protection. Constantly looking for work and will cave in pass rusher engaged with his teammate.	Feet are a little bit heavy and he can be a little plodding when asked to block in space. Doesn't possess second level quickness to consistently get to cut­off blocks. Sluggish change of direction may turn his near misses into sacks and tackles for losses against NFL athletes. Arm length is below average so he will need more core strength to drop anchor and take a stand. Uses crab-­hand punch with hands outside the frame allowing forward leaning bull rushers to push the pocket. As game progresses, shows some waist-­bending tendencies.	T.J. Lang	Average athlete, but a good football player. Dahl fights through his limitations using determination and toughness. He will have to make a move inside and needs to continue to hit the training table and weight room to add even more mass to his frame. Dahl has potential as a drive blocking guard but needs to play with better hand placement to maximize results. Dahl projects as an eventual starting guard.	"Stud! Really tough. Played through injuries which put some shaky tape out there but if you watch him when he's healthy there ain't no doubt what he's going to do in the pros." -- Pac-12 scout	54	5.40000000000000036	joe-dahl	\N
2555137	Jordan	Walsh	6	74	292	\N	It?s no wonder that the Hawkeyes had success on offense in 2015 with guys like Walsh up front. The three-year starter at right guard stands up his man in pass protection and anchors despite a slightish frame. He impressed league coaches enough, using his agility and explosion, to be voted first-team All-Conference this fall. Expect NFL offensive line coaches to be similarly captivated with his skill set.	Plays with good foot quickness and works his combination blocks with excellent timing and teamwork. Technique in pass protection showed great improvement from 2014 to 2015. Consistent hand placement is big for him. Mirrors well with ability shuffle and changes directions with ease. Hands always at the ready and uses quick­-triggered, well-­placed punch to counter his lack of size in pass protection. Comes out of snaps with flat ­back and low pads. Able to adjust his body and blocks when engaged in space. Well-coached. Can keep defenders moving on zone plays and is able to kick out and finish. His tape was very consistent throughout the season.	Play strength is average and he must add mass. Has some tenacity as a blocker, but needs technique to be on ­point to handle NFL size up front. Will need to eliminate leaning on second level blocks to improve his sustained blocking. Babies his cut blocks. Needs to get better at working through target. Unlikely to generate power or movement at point of attack as base blocker. Won?t fit in power-­based run game. Base gets a little wide in pass protection. At times, labors to pass off initial twist which puts him behind when next man comes his way over the top. Strength to secure cross-­face blocks and overall contact balance in question. Anchor is average against bull rushers.	John Urschel	Combine with center and teammate Austin Blythe to become an extremely consistent tandem that helped to spring the running game this season. Walsh plays with good hand usage and his play strength isn't bad for his size, but unless he's hiding weight somewhere, a move to center might be in his future.	\N	32	5	jordan-walsh	\N
2555138	Joshua	Garnett	6	76	312	10.125	Garnett, the son of an NFL nose tackle (Scott Garnett), played in the shadow of other NFL-ready Stanford linemen like 2015 first-round pick Andrus Peat before his senior year. He emerged from that shadow this fall, however, winning numerous All-American honors and the Outland Trophy as the nation?s top interior lineman. His combination of size (6-5, 325) and movement dropped jaws around college football -- especially when he takes an occasional turn as an H-back. Add intelligence and a nasty streak, and Garnett?s got everything an offensive line coach would want to be part of his group.	Powerful frame with dense, muscular lower body. Very powerful at point of attack -- especially as base blocker. Held his own in the power department against UCLA?s Kenny Clark. If he gets downhill momentum on defender, it?s lights out. Able to strike and center his blocks between his shoulders. Team captain. Very good hand placement, upper body strength and hip torque to steer and turn opponent on hook blocks. Generates good power from legs and hips. Block winner in tight space near goal line. Takes good angles to second level block to make up for his lack of athleticism. Hard to beat him early in the rep on run plays. Can bury gap shooters with cave­-in blocks. Comes out of stance with good bend, pad level explosion into target. Has power and hand strength to snap off twisters and receive incoming defender. Well schooled with good hand work.	Despite being asked to pull and get cut-­off blocks at Stanford, he has some athletic limitations that could be magnified in pros. Slow to get out in front on long pulls. Gets a little lazy with his feet and tries to outmuscle opponents rather than combining strength with proper footwork. Falls in love with mashing opponents within the early stages of a rep and forgets to bring his feet under him to secure the block causing him to fall off at times. Head­-ducking pass protector who misses twists at times because he sees them too late. Opens himself up to problems against crafty defensive tackles by leaning too much in protection. More of a hug and contain approach against rushers rather than inside punch.	Gabe Jackson	Thick, powerful guard who can gain an early advantage in the rep and finish with authority. Garnett looks to establish a new line of scrimmage on every running play and is a great fit for a team looking to impose their will between the tackles. While he?s a plus run blocker, his pass protection issues should not be taken lightly and will have to be vetted with offensive line coaches to make sure they are correctable issues. Garnett should be an early round pick who can come in and start right away.	"He's a physical dude but needs to clean up his body some. The team nutritionist will be important for him. Love the power, but a little worried that he can?t unlock his hips." ­ -- NFC Pac-12 scout	51	5.88999999999999968	joshua-garnett	\N
2555140	Lene	Maiava	6	76	301	\N	In his first year as a full-time starter, Maiava (my-AH-vah) earned enough love from scouts to earn postseason all-star game invitations. The Wildcats' senior right tackle started all 13 games for the squad in the fall, after coming in a "super sub" in his sophomore and junior years. Maiava stepped in for seven starts at either guard spot as well as one as right tackle in 2013 and 2014. The Samoan didn't know any English when he arrived in the United State for the 2011 Polynesian All-American Bowl, and also went through adversity during his redshirt freshman season when he suffered a season-ending torn ACL.	Has ability to generate push as a drive blocker. Accelerates into his block and churns his feet to widen rushing lanes when down blocking. Possesses adequate power to play inside. Decent lateral agility and quickness and is an effective cut blocker. Uses fluid, jabbing punch and works to re­set hands when they are out of position. Improved pass protection technique as season progressed. Will lean at times, but isn?t a head ducker. Athletic enough to pull and get out in front. Has experience at both guard spots and right tackle.	Has long torso and short legs. Tight hips cause issues gaining necessary ground with kick­slide in pass pro making life as an NFL tackle challenging. When he senses his edge is threatened by speed, he?ll lean and lunge. Has issues over­setting and opening a lane to his quarterback. Lacks recovery skills. Once beaten around the corner, it?s over. Struggles maintaining proper weight distribution causing him to play on skates when in space. Marginal instincts. Slow to adjust his plans as run blocker and can be fooled by blitz looks.	\N	Pass protection from 2015 was problematic at right tackle, but his guard tape from 2014 was more promising and showed a better fit for his strengths. Maiava?s issue with balance and body control could make him an inconsistent blocker in both the run and pass, but he will step up and whip his man from time to time. There is enough to like that gives him a shot at making a run in camp and potentially finding a practice squad.	\N	46	5.07000000000000028	lene-maiava	\N
2555141	Marquis	Lucas	6	75	319	\N	Lucas' life came more into focus when he became a father early last year, as he knew that he could help provide for his family with hard work in the classroom and on the football field. And with leaders on the offensive line Mark Glowinski and Quinton Spain leaving school, Lucas got his opportunity to step into a leadership role. Not that he hadn't contributed in previous years; Lucas was a reserve in his redshirt freshman season, started four games at guard in 2013, and then started all 13 games at right tackle as a junior. He made the move to the left side for the Mountaineers this fall, and he grabbed the attention of NFL scouts in the process.	Might offer roster flexibility as a reserve guard or tackle. Has serviceable foot quickness in his pass sets and climbing to the second level. Understands hand placement and will work to re­establish his hands inside when beaten to the punch by defender. Strong hands to grasp and ride it out. Shows patience and timing when shooting his hands in pass pro. Uses proper angles and footwork when bouncing to second block of a combo. Not a great athlete but good enough to be considered by teams. Plays with composure and doesn?t show much panic no matter who he is facing.	Flexibility is a concern as he doesn't show much hip bend causing him to play way higher than desired. Not as tall as desired from the tackle position and doesn't have above average arm length to make up for it. Some scouts concerned over hand quickness if bumped inside to guard. Needs to improve pad level for more leverage at point of attack. Not much initial jolt at first contact, feet slow and base tends to narrow robbing him of build up power. Cross­-face blocks could be a chore. Plays from behind when facing plus athletes.	\N	Primarily a tackle in college, some evaluators do not believe he has enough overall length to be considered as a tackle prospect, but rather a guard. Lucas does a respectable job as a college lineman, but a jump in competition at the professional level could expose some physical flaws that won't be easily correctable. Lucas could make it into an NFL camp at some point.	\N	29	4.90000000000000036	marquis-lucas	\N
2555142	Rees	Odhiambo	6	76	314	9.625	The native of Kenya has been impressive over the past three years when healthy, displaying pro-caliber footwork and a solid anchor in pass protection while earning All-Conference honors the past two years (second-team in 2014, first-team in 2015). However, Odhiambo (pronounced AH-dee-AHM-bo) has not been able to start more than nine games in any season due to injuries (he broke his ankle in this season?s ninth game). Still, whether he serves as an undersized tackle or proves strong enough to move inside (like former Boise State LT Daryn Colledge), Odhiambo has starter-quality skills.	Played tackle in college but will be considered at both tackle and guard and carries some two­-position value. Looks great on the hoof with muscle and thickness throughout his frame. Flexible hips and knees and should be able to drop his pad level as guard in the pros. Uses wide, well­-balanced base and possesses above-­average body control. Tough, technique­-driven approach. Uses feet to close distance with target rather than reaching, leaning and panicking. Able to maintain power when moving laterally. Has athleticism and body control to be effective pulling guard and zone scheme fit as right tackle or guard. Keeps eyes up and on his target at all times. Can mirror and punch with inside hands. Upper body strength and hip snap to turn opponent as base blocker. Has heavy hands and makes defenders feel it when he lands.	Suffered a broken ankle that knocked him out for the season in late October. Has had to cope with injuries during his time at Boise. Never played a full season of football. Despite his physical talent, will let blocks get away from him that appear to be secured. Can be late with his hands. Not as tall or long as NFL teams are looking for from NFL tackles. Will need to prove he can play with faster hands if he bumps inside to guard. At times lingers with his punch opening him up to issues with crafty interior defenders. Would like to see him snatch and maintain his grasp rather than just punching and pushing. Despite his bend, doesn?t always generate the leverage he should at the point of attack.	Ali Marpet	Well-­built college tackle who NFL evaluators are projecting inside to guard. Has the footwork and technique to allow a team to give him a shot at right tackle first. Odhiambo is a coachable, team­-oriented player who has the temperament, frame and strength needed to play inside, but could see his draft stock take a round or two hit if teams doubt that he can be a consistently healthy player in the pros. Odhiambo should be a fit for all schemes.	"Plays with a lot of grit and toughness. He's deeply religious and a loyal teammate. I think he's really talented and has a chance to be an outstanding guard in the league. If you try him at tackle it has to be on the right side.

2555143	Sebastian	Tretola	6	76	314	10.375	Tretola actually began his career at Nevada, redshirting one season and starting four games the next, before heading to Iowa Western Community College for the 2013 season. In his first year with the Razorbacks, he used a strong base and brute strength to pave the way for two 1,000-yard rushers in Alex Collins and Jonathan Williams. Collins again crossed the 1,000-yard barrier in 2015, benefiting from Tretola's (who earned first-team All-SEC honors as a senior) mauling ways.	Outstanding frame and overall thickness throughout. Powerful upper body strength with a natural anchor down below. Won't lose many "power-on-power" scraps. Built like a bruising, NFL-­caliber guard in a power scheme. Can dominate as a base blocker. Possesses the will and exceptional power to generate early movement and take control of the neutral zone. When he gets his arms locked out, it's usually over for defenders. Nasty play demeanor. Arkansas staff can?t speak highly enough about him. One of the unsung catalysts over last two seasons for Arkansas? power rushing attack. Willing to sumo fight with his hands and work to re-position them at the point of attack. Not a natural bender, but does work hard at trying to keep pad level as low as he can. Faced off against first round defensive tackle talent in the SEC and answered the bell. Recognizes twists and games up front. Mindful with footwork in lateral and can be more effective than expected when asked to reach and hook defenders.	Short area, phone booth plodder. Noticeable leg stiffness with limited area of effectiveness. Feet stay stuck in the grass after initial contact leaving him susceptible to falling off blocks. Turns into a mauling, bear­-hugger as second-level blocker. Inconsistent on combo­ blocks struggling to get off first block and up to the linebacker. Lack of athleticism limits ability to take quality angles up to flowing linebackers. Will duck head into contact in pass protection and has issues with over­-setting against athletic tackles. Has issues with leaning and wide hands in pass pro that are unlikely to change in the pros. Ineffective at changing direction and reacting to sudden a­-gap slashers and is likely to get your quarterback hit from time to time. Balance and body control are below average -- especially on the move.	Bobby Hart	Tretola plays with the in­-your­-face power and toughness that has been a perfect fit for Bret Bielema's, physical rushing attack in Arkansas. While he has the power to be one of the more physical NFL guards as soon as he steps into a camp, his stiffness and marginal athleticism could limit his draft stock and the amount of teams willing to consider him. Tretola could be an eventual starter in the league, but it will likely be for a team looking to grind it out between the tackles.	\N	89	5.38999999999999968	sebastian-tretola	\N
2555470	Cayleb	Jones	4	75	209	9.25	As a hometown hero from Austin and the son of former Butkus Award finalist at East Carolina and star NFL linebacker Robert Jones, big things were expected from Cayleb when he arrived on the University of Texas campus. He contributed a bit as a true freshman (2-25 receiving in 11 games) before running into trouble in March 2013, being charged with felony aggravated assault after hitting and breaking the jaw of a UT tennis player. The charges were eventually reduced, but the damage was done and he decided to get a fresh start in Tucson. He redshirted the 2013 season before leading the Wildcats in receiving as a junior (73 catches, 1,019 yards, nine touchdowns) and garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors. Jones was Arizona's lead receiver again last fall, catching 55 passes for 904 yards and five scores.	Comes from football bloodlines. His father, Robert, was a 10-year linebacker in the NFL and his uncle is former starting quarterback, Jeff Blake. Tall and long. Uses his length to the best of his ability high-pointing balls that look destined to be overthrows. Dangerous fade target in the red ­zone who can pick it over the heads of smaller corners. Extremely productive sophomore season. Ball tracker who finds some late separation on vertical routes.	Upright target. Easy for press corners to get under his pads and jam his release. Feet lack initial quickness to make press corners pay. Looks slow on tape. Might have to live with defenders in his pocket if he makes it in the league. Stiff hips offer little sink into breaks and routes are sluggish and sloppy. Arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault at Texas before transferring to Arizona. The charge was reduced to misdemeanor.	\N	While the size and length are there to be a factor in the red area, Jones really struggles to free himself against aggressive press coverage and is missing the NFL deep speed to make defenders pay up top. He has some of the pieces, but maybe not enough.	\N	46	4.96999999999999975	cayleb-jones	\N
2555144	Spencer	Drango	6	78	315	9.5	A four-year starter, there's no questioning Drango's intensity or strength at the line of scrimmage. The 2014 consensus and 2015 unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference pick has the size and strength to lock onto defensive ends, but still has the mobility to pull inside to lead for a rushing attack that ranks in the top three in the country in rushing yards, including an astounding 645 against North Carolina in the Russell Athletic Bowl.	Doesn't always look pretty, but Drango gets guys blocked. Figures to move inside to guard as a pro which better suits his game. Has some mean that will show itself during the game. Loves to mash defenders into the ground with a strong finish when he gets a chance. Powerful upper body. Able to push players around if he takes an early lead in the rep. Has ability to seal his down ­blocks with authority. Asked to play in space in Baylor running game and will be able to do same as an NFL guard. Quality setup in his pass sets with properly distributed weight.	Unusually high­-cut body type with a barrel chest, extra weight through his midsection but average lower body. One scout referred to it as a "Spongebob frame". When attempting to pull, has an unusual and exaggerated hitch out of his stance. Plays like a short-­armed lineman rather than a guy with decent arm length (33-inch arms). Has a slow, predictable punch in pass protection which is too easily countered by defenders. Has difficulty landing and maintaining proper hand placement through his run blocks which hinders ability to sustain. Slow to redistribute weight and change direction.	Mike McGlynn	While he has NFL power in his upper body, that power could be mitigated because he allows defenders into his framework too quickly. Drango has decent pass protection technique, an anchor and the toughness for an interior line spot, but scouts question whether or not he has a "hang your hat on" play trait that can make him anything more than a backup or a low-­end starter.	"I've got a late Day 3 grade on him. He's not a very good athlete and I don?t see a dominant run blocker as an NFL guard. I think he'll bounce around the league for a few years and that's it." ­-- NFC pro personnel	10	5.20000000000000018	spencer-drango	\N
2555145	Ted	Karras	6	75	307	\N	Talk about a football family -- seven members of the Karras clan have played Big Ten football, and four of them went on to the NFL, including the late Pro Bowler Alex Karras, who is Ted's great uncle. Growing up around the game certainly aided his development as a player, but name recognition isn't why he's on this list. The 2014 and 2015 honorable mention All-Big Ten pick has been a starter for the Illini since arriving on campus, although he missed the final four games of his junior season with a torn left ACL and MCL. Karras bounced back to start all 12 games, playing quite well, as a senior.	Four-year starter at right guard. Uses brute upper body strength to get defenders turned and sealed. Drops a hammer on down blocks to knock running lanes open. Effective power in small spaces. Adequate hand placement, but generally keeps them inside. Gritty demeanor on the field. Quality pass sets with a heavy-­handed punch. Rare football lineage as the seventh member of the Karras family to play in the Big Ten. Intensity on game day is legendary. Penalized just twice over the last two seasons. Decent body control.	Plays with stiffness in his lower half, and his lack of functional knee­ bend will always limit his leverage and blocking range. Usually not the low man as base blocker. Unable to sit down and change directions effectively in space. Execution of second level blocks is below par. Has issues sustaining blocks when moving laterally. Susceptible to an occasional bull rush.	\N	Karras is limited by his lack of functional athleticism, but his technique combined with moderate body control gives him a chance to fight for a roster spot with a power-­based running game looking for tough guys.	\N	30	5.16000000000000014	ted-karras	\N
2555146	Vadal	Alexander	6	77	326	10.5	After starting for two years next to La'el Collins at left guard (earning second-team All-SEC honors as a junior), Alexander moved back to right tackle (where he earned freshman All-American honors in starting the final seven games in 2012) for his senior year. He played well enough on the outside to earn first-team All-SEC honors in 2015. Alexander shed at least 30 pounds since arriving on campus, giving him a shot to stay at tackle when he arrives in the NFL. Otherwise, he projects as a powerful inside player.	Mammoth frame will give him a size advantage over just about everyone he lines up against. Is at his best as a downhill blocker. Natural power that just needs to be harnessed and unlocked. Can cave in defenders with his down­blocks and has power in his hands to jolt linebackers when he can square them up. Has enough leg drive to generate movement as a base blocker when his pad level is right. Has the frame and natural power to anchor up against bull­ rushers as a guard. Massive frame includes long arms that can control a defender when he gets his hands on defender first. Has length and upper body strength to help him recover against inside moves to the A-gap.	Very slow, plodding feet. Has issues redirecting himself to handle sudden change of direction by the defender and his lack of lateral quickness forces him into a phone booth on the next level. Struggles to get good angles on second level blocks. Below average balance and overall body control. Lower body stiffness and limited bend is a concern. Doesn't bring feet under him after contact so he struggles to secure blocks. On combo blocks, has a low connection rate when climbing up to linebackers. Too passive out of stance, failing to fire into defender and take control of the rep. Only a guard prospect -- not athletic enough to play tackle. Bad habit of using wide, corralling hands in pass pro rather than using his length and hands as instruments of force. Continued tape study shows too many mental mistakes in both run and pass.	John Jerry	Teams will no doubt be intrigued by Alexander's length, size and power, but this year should have proved that his only position in the pros is at guard and that his lack of athleticism could limit which teams will consider him in the draft. Alexander has enough power in tight quarters to win one­-on-­one battles, but his lack of balance and functional footwork will diminish his success rate as a block finisher. It might be Alexander's best interest to lean down in an attempt to improve his quickness and overall body control if he is to become a consistent, NFL player.	"Watch him play and you'll notice that his man is always around the play. You hardly ever see him still blocking his man when the whistle blows because he can't sustain blocks. All the size and power in the world won't matter if you can't keep putting it on the guy across you." -- AFC College Director of Scouting	91	5.41999999999999993	vadal-alexander	\N
2555147	Vi	Teofilo	6	75	305	\N	Vi Teofilo (VEE TAY-oh-FEE-low) was brought from American Somoa to Arizona at the age of 12 to live with his brothers. The move paid off, as he used his size and athleticism to excel on the football field and win a state heavyweight wrestling title. He started three games as a redshirt freshman, portending his three-year reign at the right guard spot for the Sun Devils. Teofilo started 40 straight contests from 2012 to 2015 despite tearing his right ACL against Duke in the 2014 Sun Bowl. The two-time honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick played through the injury that day, and despite having surgery after the season, returned for the 2015 opener.	Not overly athletic, but has some short-area quickness and gets out of his stance and moves fairly fluidly in pulling situations. Has necessary understanding of angles up to the second level. Has some pop in his initial contact. Anticipates when twists are coming and will come off of first block to go get twister. Good balance and ready hands in pass pro. Solid with his hands. Works well with his center and is relatively smooth in his combo blocks.	Too often leans and pushes as a blocker and finds himself falling off of blocks because he doesn?t always bring his feet up under him. Not a natural drive blocker and appears to struggle generating power with his leg drive. Hips and feet are slow to do their jobs when trying to step back inside against counter moves. Active, athletic pass rushers could be an issue for him throughout his career. Arm length expected to fall under 31 inches which is well below the functional line.	\N	Aggressive three-­year starter at guard for the Sun Devils who is more worker bee than standout on the college level. He has just enough strength and just enough functional movement skills to have a shot in the NFL, but he may always fall prey to early length and late strength from players across from him. Teofilo might be limited to a backup role in the pros, but he could help his cause by proving he can snap the ball and play some center as well.	\N	45	5	vi-teofilo	\N
2555362	Aaron	Burbridge	4	72	206	8.25	The former top national recruit went from a solid contributor (29 catches, 358 yards, one score) as a junior to a big-time playmaker for quarterback Connor Cook and the Spartans in 2015. Burbridge was named the Big Ten Receiver of the Year as a senior, as well as first-team all-conference by league coaches and media after nabbing 85 catches for 1,258 yards (with seven touchdowns). Both those figures led the Big Ten, becoming just the second Spartans player to lead the conference in that category (Kirk Gibson in 1976 and 1978). When Cook went back to pass, his first, second and third looks were to Burbridge as he trusted his teammate to make the clutch third-down catch as well as high-point the deep ball.	Has the body control and in­-air athleticism to contort and come down with spectacular catches. Able to drop down and secure low throws and extend beyond his frame for diving catches left or right. At his best breaking off routes with suddenness and opening quickly for timing throws. Better at coming out of breaks to his left over his right. Detailed route-­runner on double moves creating openings for big plays up top. Once on top of cornerbacks, looks to stack them to create throwing window for touch throws. Excellent at tracking the deep ball. Has 19 catches of 25-plus yards. Willing to match physical with physical at the top of his routes against huggers. Shows some aggressiveness as run blocker and gives effort when working up to safeties.	Hands are inconsistent and don't appear to be strong enough to consistently succeed on contested catches. Showed some focus issues when routes worked towards the middle. Average foot quickness from press release. Play speed is consistent, but doesn't have an extra gear. Needs to do a better job of selling the deep route to back cornerbacks off. Acceleration from breaks is average. Film shows potential concern getting away from press cleanly. Doesn't win enough near the end zone. Gaudy stats took a big hit against upper-­echelon competition. Hasn?t proven to be a playmaker after the catch.	Jason Avant	Outside receiver with good height and weight but lacking the deep speed to beat NFL cornerbacks down the field. Burbridge has enough short-area quickness to be an effective target against zone coverage, but could have problems against tight, press­ man. A move inside as a big slot receiver could be in his best interest. His Senior Bowl week and NFL Scouting Combine 40 time will be huge for his draft positioning.	"I like the competitor but I'm not crazy about the athlete. I think he'll have to move inside and be a slot but he will benefit from more accurate quarterbacking." -- NFC North scout	34	5.44000000000000039	aaron-burbridge	\N
2555148	Bryce	Williams	5	78	257	9.625	Williams actually walked on for two programs in his career, first for a redshirt season at Marshall in 2011 and then in the fall of 2012 at ECU. In the past three years, he hasn't looked like a walk-on at all, earning all-conference accolades in 2013 (honorable mention), 2014 (second team) and 2015 (first team). As a fullback in the Pirates' offense as a sophomore and junior, Williams used his 6-6, 250-pound frame to its fullest in the red zone (four touchdowns), out-leaping smaller defensive backs to attack the ball in the air. As a senior, Williams has been used more regularly as an all-around receiving threat, finishing second on the team with 58 receptions for 588 yards and four scores.	Big target who plays to his size in the passing game. Consistent arm extension as a pass catcher with a smooth ?pluck and tuck? approach. Makes catches with defenders draped all over him and is willing to secure the throw and take the lick in the middle of a field. Consistent high­-point catcher with excellent ball tracking and concentration downfield. Quick first five strides off line of scrimmage and into his routes. Sneaky fast in the seam and can surprise complacent safeties who sleep on him. Adjusts to scrambling quarterbacks by freeing himself and becoming a moving target. Not overly shifty in open spaces as runner, but will gain additional yardage by leaning into tacklers and finishes his catches. Even without having dog in him as a blocker, has the frame to offer some effective resistance to smaller would­-be tacklers.	More straight­-line speed than fluid movement along his routes. Gives away direction of his patterns with early head turns. Still running raw, sloppy routes that need work. Just out running in space at times. Gets caught drifting at top of crossing routes allowing safeties to squeeze him. Needs to play with consistent play speed. Finesse, positional run blocker relying on overall size over assertiveness and desire and grit. As a move blocker, ducks head into block and absorbs more of the contact than he doles out.	Gavin Escobar	Williams added 13 pounds of muscle onto his frame last summer and it offered no visible drain on overall athleticism or speed. As a blocker, Williams needs more toughness and attitude to go with his size, but as a pass catcher, he has the tools and field-­stretching potential that offensive coordinators are looking for. Williams won?t be every team?s cup of tight end coffee, but for teams looking for a matchup tight end, he will be intriguing.	\N	57	5.24000000000000021	bryce-williams	\N
2555149	Jake	McGee	5	77	250	9.625	McGee took advantage of the graduate transfer rule that allows athletes to finish their eligibility at another school once they have completed their bachelor's degree without sitting out a season. Although he wasn't a full-time starter at Virginia, he led the team in receiving (43-395, 2 TD) in 2013 and played well as a sophomore (28-374, five TD) after contributing on special teams (eight tackles) as a redshirt freshman. It seemed as though he was going to contribute right away for the Gators; unfortunately, he broke his left leg (fibula and tibia) in the season opener and spent the year rehabbing. As a sixth-year senior, he showed real promise as a reliable move-the-chains receiver and red zone target due to his size and athleticism (41-381, four TD), even earning second team All-SEC honors from league media.	Hands for days. Uses every bit of his catch radius and has elite concentration. Can adjust and catch it high, low or behind him with hands like a shortstop. Former high school quarterback who recognizes when he's hot receiver against blitz and opens quickly. Scouts rave about his outgoing personality and ability to bring locker room together. Considered great teammate who leads by example. Used frequently as a move blocker in Florida offense and has tools to improve in that area. Has acceleration on crossing routes to separate from safeties and linebackers.	Drifts into out-­breaking routes giving his intentions away to eager defenders. Needs to work on separation tactics and tightening up his underneath routes. Inconsistent run blocker. Ducks head into contact and fails to make consistently squared contact. Missing play strength to scrap it out and win the edge battle in running game. Duck-footed grass-pounder when getting into routes from three­-point stance. Six-year collegian who is already 24 years old. Failed to log a catch of 20-plus yards during 2015 season.	Maxx Williams	McGee probably won't blow the combine away with athletic traits, but he has quality play speed in his routes and hands like a gold glove shortstop. Like Maxx Williams in Baltimore, McGee will need time to improve his routes and run blocking before he should be expected to log significant snaps but he has starter's potential.	\N	82	5.29999999999999982	jake-mcgee	\N
2555150	Alex	Kinal	19	74	209	9.125	\N	Australian import with a cult following in Winston-­Salem. Holds FBS record for most punts in a career. Able to adjust high, low and laterally to poor snaps. Team captain and respected in the locker room. Landed 44 percent of his punts inside the 20 yard line this year. Can adjust snap­-to­-punt speed when needed.	Low­-trajectory punter with a below-average hang time. Allowed three punt return touchdowns over last two seasons. Ball doesn?t come off his foot with consistent boom. Slow snap­-to­punt timing due to his punting style.	\N	Fun guy with a great story, but may not have the leg to make it in the NFL despite his outrageously high number of total punts while in college.	\N	9	4.79999999999999982	alex-kinal	\N
2555151	Drew	Kaser	19	74	212	\N	Nearly every year, at least one punter hears his name called in the top 200 picks; it could be Kaser in 2016 because he possesses a quick delivery as well as the leg strength and hang time to consistently change field position. He was an All-American and Ray Guy Award finalist in 2013 after leading the SEC with a 47.4-yard average (beating perennial Pro Bowler Shane Lechler's school record), and had nice follow-up seasons in 2014 (44.5-yard average, 19-of-56 punts inside the 20). Kaser broke that school record again in 2015 (47.47) on his way to first team All-SEC honors, placing 21 of 60 punts inside the 20-yard line. He also threatened the SEC career record with a 46.2 career gross average.	Possesses a booming right leg. Had punts of 53 yards or more in 17 of his past 24 games. Had punts of 64-plus yards in five of 11 games this season. Athletic with good hands. Has ability to adjust to poor snaps. Able to speed up punt process when he sees pressure coming. Good touch near endzone with 17 percent of his punts ending up inside the 10.	Gets excited about showing off his big leg and will outkick his coverage. Could use a little more hang time. Almost 38 percent of his punts were returned last year. Had a couple of mis­hits when he felt pressure coming.	Donnie Jones	Draftable punter with the leg strength to dig his team out of a field position hole and the touch to be effective once he hits midfield.	\N	20	5.40000000000000036	drew-kaser	\N
2555152	Riley	Dixon	19	76	221	9.625	Dixon's a tall, long-legged kicker who impresses with his ability to hang punts in the air to force fair catches: 88 of them, in fact, over the past three years. The 2015 second-team All-ACC pick (by coaches, first team by media) has the leg strength to boot the ball over 50 yards on a regular basis (50 of 215 punts from 2013-2015), as well. He averaged over 42 yards a punt the past three seasons, finishing with a 43.7 mark as a senior. Like most college punters, Dixon will have to speed up his delivery a bit when facing NFL rushes. If he can make that adjustment, Dixon has the tools to win a job in the NFL.	Good ratio of hang time to distance punted. Forced a whopping 40.8 percent (2014) and 42.4 percent (2015) fair catches over his last two seasons. Played with poise when pressure was coming. Able to dig low snaps off the turf. Able to control punts near end zone with just nine touchbacks over the last two years.	Average leg strength. Punting average helped along by some bounce and roll punts. Dome kicker who showed some issues with wind at times when venturing outdoors.	\N	Big punter with relatively calm demeanor and a ?what you see, is what you get? skill set as a punter. While he may be mindful of keeping the ball out of the end zone, his lack of a big leg will likely cause him to go undrafted.	\N	26	4.82000000000000028	riley-dixon	\N
2555153	Will	Monday	19	76	212	8.875	Monday's name showed up on the all-conference honors list each of the last four years, as he consistently kicked the opposition into bad situations. He led the ACC in gross punting average as a true freshman (44.6 yards per kick), garnering first-team all-conference notice after the season. Monday slipped a bit as a sophomore, but received third-team honors from league coaches by averaging 42.7 yard per punt and landing 21 kicks inside the 20-yard line. He was a third team pick again in 2014 (43.0 gross average, 17 inside the 20, 21 fair catches) and improved to second-team All-ACC in his final year (43.5 gross average, 31 inside the 20, 20 fair catches). Monday had three kicks over 70 yards during his career, and had none blocked.	Successful run as a four-year punter. Will flash power in his right leg. One of the best in the business this season at killing punts inside the 20 yard line at 46.7 percent. Quick 1.75 second snap-­to­-punt time. Soft, confident hands. Allowed mind­-boggling 80 return yards total over last two seasons.	Hang time needs to improve. Saw some inconsistency with the way he struck the ball in 2015. Would like to see more leg from him on a consistent basis.	\N	Long­-limbed punter who showed off more consistent power in his foot earlier in his career than later.

2555154	Darian	Thompson	15	74	208	9.125	Thompson received All-American recognition in each of the past two seasons. After picking off seven passes in 2014, he added five more in just 11 games this season, totaling 19 for his career (tied for the most of any player in the country). But the 6-foot-2, 205-pound defender isn't just a ballhawk -- he is a physical presence in the secondary and solid tackler in space (242 career tackles) and behind the line of scrimmage (8.5 tackles for loss in 2015). Another impressive season in 2015, even though he missed the final two regular season games with a concussion, cemented his status as one of the best all-around safeties in the draft class.	Tall, angular build for the position. Eye­-popping interception numbers (19) becoming the all­-time leader in Boise State history this season. Soft hands and can make difficult, diving interceptions. Willing to take a chance to undercut throws and will run through receivers catch point to disrupt. Ready hitter with desired physical demeanor to play around line of scrimmage. Willing to sacrifice his body against pulling linemen in order to cave in the edge. Able to bob and weave around traffic and consistently choose the correct lane to find running backs. Saw tackle for loss numbers increase each year and will make his own luck on other side of the line.	Instincts and awareness in coverage will scare coaches when they study the tape. Allowed receivers to get way behind him multiple times against BYU. Undisciplined. Seems to lose track of targets around him and can be baited to vacate his deep responsibilities by crossing routes in front of him. Allowed 10 touchdowns over last three years. Needs to play with more technique and less improv. Hip tightness hinders ability to open quickly and run with necessary speed to close separation. Plays tall in space and quick lateral movement and basic change of direction can be a challenge at times. Needs to slow and gather himself when charging downhill to avoid missed tackles.	Morgan Burnett	Looks the part and has enough production to warrant a close look, but that close look shows a player with below average man cover skills and a lack of awareness in zone coverage. An even greater concern is that too many big plays were allowed because he busted coverage or failed or to execute. Thompson does his best work near the line of scrimmage and has the frame and demeanor to become a box safety in the league, but it might take time.	\N	108	5.51999999999999957	darian-thompson	\N
2555155	Deon	Bush	15	72	199	9.25	The 'Canes haven't had a safety drafted since Brandon Meriweather and Kenny Phillips went in the first round in 2007 and 2008, respectively. That will change in 2016, with Bush offering range and intimidating hits in the back of the secondary. The Miami native and 2015 honorable mention All-ACC honoree could join the aforementioned "U" talents as NFL players because he can separate the ball from its previous owner (five forced fumbles in 2014), attack the line of scrimmage (103 tackles in 2014-2015, seven for losses), and make plays on the ball in deep coverage (four interceptions, 13 pass breakups in his career). NFL teams will also like his character. The American Football Coaches Association put him on their All-Good Works team this season, and he donated his per diem money from the Independence Bowl for Christmas gifts for homeless children.	Has good size for the position. Has no problem with the physical part of the game and won?t hesitate to come strike. Comes downhill under control looking to mirror the runner. Will gather feet under him, bend and uncoil with with force into tackle. Usually looks to wrap ­up as a tackler. Forced four fumbles in 2014. Expected to run well in his workouts. Good leaper. Can get up and disrupt at the high point. Able to turn and run from the hash. Appears comfortable and capable in zone coverage underneath. Has blitz capabilities from sub­packages as a pro. Determined special teams effort. Has ability to excel on all coverage teams.	Has some straight­-line speed and is an explosive leaper, but is lacking in dynamic athleticism. Struggles to change direction in space effecting coverage and tackling. Saw a sharp decline in his tackle success rate in 2015. Plays through a straw. From two-­deep, gets hyper­-focused on receivers to his side and doesn?t read development of play. Shows pre­-snap confusion at times on tape. Lack of instincts and feel for the position limit his range and playmaking ability outside his initial area. Struggles to flip hips and run and doesn?t close separation quickly enough. Late to respond to throws in his area.	Mo Alexander	Bush?s diagnostic skills are very much a work in progress and his 2015 tape will be enough to concern general managers and secondary coaches. Bush has the size and measurables that will appeal to traits-based defenses and his special teams ability could earn him a spot on the coverage teams right off the bat. However, his stiffness in space and issues with change of direction projects him as a special teams specialist with only box safety potential.	"Put some horrific tape together this year. His Florida State game was a disaster. I expect him to put some numbers up at the combine that get him drafted earlier than he should be. I think he's a mid-rounder with very good special teams value but will need to be a backup box safety-­type of player early in his career." ­-- AFC North scout	23	5.26999999999999957	deon-bush	\N
2555156	Jayron	Kearse	15	76	216	9.625	Clemson may have locked up Kearse as a recruit by giving him the choice of playing safety or receiver once arriving on campus. Not only did he prefer the physical aspects of the game in spite of his frame, but he also has some excellent family resources to access on the defensive side of the ball; his uncle is former Florida and NFL pass rusher extraordinaire Jevon Kearse and cousin is former Miami and NFL star cornerback Phillip Buchanon. He started just three games in his freshman season, playing in 12, but still managed to make 55 tackles and tie for the team lead with four interceptions. Kearse started at safety his sophomore campaign (67 stops, five for loss, three sacks, two interceptions) and continued that success in a first-team All-ACC junior season (62 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one interception, six pass break-ups). The Associated Press voted him second team All-American in 2015, as well, as he joined a bevy of talented defenders and Heisman hopeful quarterback Deshaun Watson in putting together an undefeated regular season and national championship game appearance.	Freakishly tall and long for the position with limbs that go on for days. Straight line athlete with long- strides who is able to come from two­-deep and close ground quickly on deep sideline throws. Suited for single-­high coverage. Will read quarterback?s eyes and shade coverage accordingly while staying deeper than the deepest receiver. Deployed near line of scrimmage with some success. Has the length and range to become a volume tackler if his desire improves. Able to contribute immediately on special teams coverage and finished 2015 with seven special teams tackles. Coaches commend him for his personal growth and improved maturity.	Built more like a rail-­thin shooting guard than a safety. Play demeanor and effort level can best be described as blasé. Slow to get set pre­snap. When playing near line of scrimmage, was slow to diagnose counters and got stuck out of position to make tackles. Want to see more urgency to make plays near in the box. Can be mismatched in man coverage by shifty slot receivers. May be too tall to open hips and accelerate quickly enough in man and change of direction is inconsistent. Production level should be much higher with his physical gifts. Too many busts in coverage leading to free running receivers.	\N	Odds are that Kearse will test well and with his length and ability, he very well may go much higher than the grade I have on him. To play safety, there needs to be a sense of urgency and consistency because that position is the last line of defense and Kearse doesn?t show those traits nearly enough at this time. If the light comes on and he gets more dog in him, then we are talking about a substantially better NFL player.	"He's a big guy, but he just doesn't make many plays. You see him out there just drifting around sometimes and you just wish he had the same attitude and fire that the rest of that defense has because he could be so much better. Do you draft him on traits and hope your coaches reach him?" -- NFC southeastern scout	1	5.38999999999999968	jayron-kearse	\N
2555174	Harlan	Miller	14	72	182	9.375	Miller was named third-team FCS All-American by The Associated Press as a junior, despite fighting through a dislocated shoulder that cost him three games. He then improved that honor to second-team AP All-American in 2015. Miller picked off 11 passes and broke up 22 others over the past three years using his height and length, earning first team All-Southland Conference honors each season. Miller also proved he could make plays on the other side of the line of scrimmage as a senior, making six tackles for loss, while additionally returning punts (15 for 175 yards), receiving first-team all-conference notice at that position. He looks to join former teammate Robert Alford (drafted in the second round by Atlanta in 2013) in the league.	Plays with quick, darting feet and has the ability to mirror and match receivers' movements down the field. Is always in hot pursuit in run support and is willing to sprint across the field to get into the action. Tenacious wrap-up tackler. Tall with good arm length. Will actively look for chances to make plays outside his area. In press, reads direction of release and slides feet in front of receiver to impede his route. Able to shift weight and change direction instantly. Hard-­charging competitor with ball skills to boot.	Thin and scouts question whether or not he can carry much more weight. Aggressiveness can get him in trouble. Will get caught peeking into backfield at play-­action and allow his man to get a jump on him from time to time. The footwork is there, but needs to improve angles to the ball to make more plays. Appears to have just marginal long speed.	Kevin Johnson	With his abundance of energy and tenacious playing style, it's hard not to love watching Harlan Miller play. While his questionable long speed and thin frame may scare some teams, his quick twitch athleticism and fluid lower body will put him into position to make his fair share of plays. His passion for run support will make him a favorite in some war rooms and could earn him a starting spot sooner than you think.	\N	1035	5.58999999999999986	harlan-miller	\N
2555157	Jordan	Simone	15	71	190	\N	Simone decided to walk on at ASU after taking a year off from football once his head coach at Washington State (Paul Wulff) was let go in 2011. He became such a problem for the offense while on the scout team that coaches gave him a shot to earn playing time -- and he did. League coaches recognized his play as a junior with honorable mention accolades, as he made 100 tackles, 4.5 for loss. Simone received those honors again in 2015 (91 tackles, four for loss, two interceptions, four pass break-ups), even though he missed the Sun Devils' final three games with a torn right ACL.	Comes from football stock with a father who played at Arizona State and a brother who played at Washington State. Muscular build. Strong desire to be near the ball. Plays near the line of scrimmage and has a reckless abandon about him. Will launch himself at full speed into tackles. The most productive tackling safety in the Pac­-12 over the last two seasons. Line-­drive style served him well as a blitzer with four sacks and seven quarterback knockdowns. Team captain.	NFL cover skills are nowhere to be found. Too slow to play in man coverage and allows receivers to get behind when playing from deep coverage. Plays through a straw and becomes overly focused on quarterback?s eyes while losing sight of receivers getting over the top. Tightly wound through his hips and lower body and unable to handle quick direction change in coverage or as an open­-field tackler. Missed a whopping 17 tackles this season and 16 last season. Had season­-ending ACL tear in November which should end any postseason workouts.	\N	Heady with productive tackle numbers, Simone is a high­-effort box safety who doesn?t have NFL speed or athleticism. While his tackle numbers over the last two years are nice, his missed tackle count is alarming. With his inability to cover, Simone would have to be a lights out tackler in the box and he is not sure­fire enough.	"Good kid and he plays hard, but he's just not athletic enough for our league." -- AFC Pac-12 scout	45	4.65000000000000036	jordan-simone	\N
2555158	Kevin	Byard	15	71	216	9.875	Although Byard looks and plays (312 career tackles) like a strong safety, he often finds himself in the back half of the secondary guarding the prize for the Blue Raiders. He?s at the top of the active player career interception list with 19, scoring on four of them in his first two years on campus, and has broken up 17 passes during that time. A four-time all-conference pick, Byard was a second-team All-Sun Belt pick (and FWAA Freshman All-American) in 2012 before garnering honorable mention All-Conference USA notice in 2013 and first team accolades in C-USA the past two seasons.	Strong football IQ. Lines secondary up and is assignment-­oriented. Disciplined in zone coverage reading and responding to the quarterback?s eyes. Scans through route developments like a quarterback. Good awareness as single-­high safety and rarely panics when faced with route combinations meant to create mistakes and indecision. Plays with smooth backpedal and adequate footwork. Always active. Former high school receiver with plus ball tracking and ball skills over the top. Holds school record with 19 career interceptions and has 19 passes defensed over the last two years. Effort never questioned and brings desired football character onto field and into locker room. Willing downhill charge against the run.	Despite his frame, not as physical a hitter as expected. Had opportunities to make the big hit but rarely chose to send that message. Active tackler, but needs to be better at squaring up and finishing with direct wrap-­up tackles rather than grab and drag finishes. Average agility to deal with trash near line of scrimmage when stepping downhill against run or screens. Can improve his angles to the ball. Slight hitch in redirecting opening door for dangerous separation by speedy targets. Below average mirror and match in man coverage. Scouts concerned with overall long speed in coverage.	\N	Byard is a four­-year starter whose ball skills and high interception total has garnered him attention since his freshman season. While he has the looks of a player who could excel near the box, he lacks the consistent physicality needed and he does his best work as a deep safety. Scouts are all over the place on Byard and his draft stock will head in one direction or the other starting with his week at the Senior Bowl.	"Ankle tackler so that's a concern and I just don't trust him in coverage. I know he has all the interceptions but I don't see a player who can match up in space against NFL-caliber receivers. I know some scouts love him because of his football IQ, but that?s not enough for me." -- NFC Director of Scouting	70	5.28000000000000025	kevin-byard	\N
2555159	Anthony	Sarao	12	71	233	\N	This New Jersey native crossed the country to wear USC Cardinal-and-Gold after an outstanding high school career (Super Prep/Prep Star All-American) where he led his team to a state title as a senior. Even though he redshirted his first year in Los Angeles, Sarao made an impact, winning the Trojans' Defensive Service Player of the Year award while terrorizing starters in practice. He was a top backup in 2012, playing every week and starting against Hawai'i (40 tackles, four for loss). Sarao moved from reserve to starter halfway through his sophomore year, starting in the middle for the final seven games (44 tackles, 2.5 TFL). He started all 13 games in 2014, stopping the ball 74 times and intercepting two passes. A team captain as a senior, Sarao racked up 59 tackles, five for loss and three sacks as a full-time starter inside despite missing spring practices with a fractured foot.	Reads his keys and flows without much hesitation to the ball. Sifts and sorts from gap to gap while peeking in on running back. Decent lateral quickness and agility in the box. Understands his job and is willing to step into his run fit and try to constrict running lanes. Rarely gobbled up by play­action. Maintains good depth and finds receivers drifting into his space. Wrap­-up, tackle finisher when he gets his chances. Has played on special teams all four years at USC. Took on more of a leadership role his senior season.	Sees it, but not fast enough to chase and cut off angles to the sideline. Play speed falls way off when asked to air it out and sprint. Although willing to leverage gap, will struggle to do so consistently due to lack of size. Needs to play downhill while taking more chances in order to avoid being engulfed on second level. Slow-moving, straight­-line blitzer without suddenness to surprise offense. Lost playing time to underclassmen his senior season.	\N	Primarily a time­share linebacker who plays steady, but lacks the productivity NFL teams generally look for from draftable linebackers. On tape, his overall speed appears to fall below the acceptable border and he doesn?t thump well enough to make a living in the box. Sarao might need to make it into camp and impress with special teams ability to have a shot.	\N	50	4.87000000000000011	anthony-sarao	\N
2555160	Antonio	Morrison	12	73	232	\N	This two-time second-team All-SEC pick is undersized, but extremely productive; he hit triple digits in tackles in 2014 (101) and 2015 (103, leading the team), and doubled his impact in the backfield between those two seasons, going from six to 12 tackles for loss. The fact he played at all this fall was a tribute to his work ethic, as he came back from undergoing multiple surgeries on his left knee to repair an injury from the 2014 Birmingham Bowl. However, teams will have to check into his background due to two arrests (punching bouncer, barking at a police dog/resisting arrest) within five weeks in the summer of 2013. If he can convince general managers that his hard times are behind him, they'll bank on his talent.	Ultra competitive with unmatched intensity. Alpha male in the locker room who teammates gravitate toward. Work ethic on full display as he recovered from a severe knee injury two to three months ahead of schedule and in time for start of the season. Plus lateral quickness. Has burst to beat offensive lineman to a spot. Not content to sit back and wait on a play. Always in attack mode. Uses explosive hips to launch into his tackles with as much force as he can. Can turn, swivel and close ground with good change of direction. Was one of the best tackle finishers in the game in 2014. Plays with extraordinary balance and is very rarely off his feet. Used as an effective spy vs. mobile quarterbacks. Could become interesting blitz option as a pro. Refuses to stop pursuing until he hears the whistle.	Suffered severe knee injury in bowl game last year that slowed his production this season. Missed seven tackles in 2015 after missing four in 2013 and 2014 combined. Undersized and lacking length for the inside backer spot. Tight strider who is more quick than fast. May not have play strength needed for his aggressive, physical style. Must learn to slip blocks and play skinny rather than always taking on all comers. Struggles to disengage quickly when locked up by offensive linemen. Doesn?t adjust pursuit path to runners, allowing combo blockers to find him. Lacks patience. Rushes downhill almost every snap and often runs himself into trouble and out of pursuit. Instincts and vision are poor. Easily fooled by play-action and can be a step late to diagnose the action. Prior off­-field incidents will need to be vetted.	Denzel Perryman	Glass eater who will be the first in line to battle. Morrison's leadership, toughness and aggressiveness will be exactly what NFL teams want, but his lack of instincts and size are barriers that may always hinder his pro potential. After his knee injury, Morrison's athleticism wasn't quite where it was in 2014 so he might be at full strength by 2016. Morrison may be too tight to play outside linebacker in a 4-­3 and lacking the instincts to play in the middle. His best fit could be as the WILB in a 3­-4 where he figures to be an eventual starter.	"Write him up however you want, but he's a two-down MIKE linebacker who is tough as hell and a good football player. I worry much less about his 'negatives' than I do with what he can do." -- AFC general manager	82	5.37000000000000011	antonio-morrison	\N
2555161	Blake	Martinez	12	74	237	10.875	In his first year as a starter in 2014, Martinez proved worthy of honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors by leading the Cardinal with 102 tackles, seven for loss, 4.5 sacks, and three interceptions. In Year 2, he played at an All-American level (third-team Associated Press, second-team USA Today) as the Cardinal won the conference championship, stuffing plays inside and moving to either sideline to rack up 141 tackles, 6.5 for loss. The 2015 first-team All-Conference pick again made plays against the pass this year, intercepting one pass and breaking up six others.	Good muscle thickness and one of the most powerful, pound­-for­-pound players in the program. Has desired temperament to play in the middle. Physical, productive tackler. Downhill linebacker. Business-minded machine against the run, maintaining consistent gap responsibility. Disciplined on back-side squeezing cutback lanes. Stuffs second level leg blocks and keeps gliding down the line. Uses heavy hands at the point of attack. Plays square to line of scrimmage with eyes stuck on runner. Plus balance and keeps his feet. Will dart and dodge past oncoming, second level traffic in lateral pursuit of ball carrier. Improved against the pass from 2014 to 2015. Showed some functional ability in man coverage and is quick to close out throws and limit yards after catch. Offers instant special teams value. Willing worker on "teams" and finds the ball.	Slow twitch with borderline play speed. Must transition from a power mindset to a little more quickness in everything he does. Will need quicker hands to jab and separate to stay clean against NFL linemen. Below average lateral quickness. Won't win many foot races to the perimeter and has little margin for error with his angles. Not athletic enough to recover if he gets hung ­up on a block for too long. Too easily fooled into vacating his positioning by play-­action. Doesn't have reactive athleticism to quickly recover back into his duties after biting on fakes. More of a block occupier than serious threat when blitzing. Average awareness dropping into zone coverage. Situational awareness needs work.	Martrell Spaight	Full-­time starter over the last two years who plays with the temperament and ruggedness that Stanford wants in the middle of their defense. Martinez is a muscled-­up, throwback linebacker in a league that covets twitch and play speed over throwback traits. His special teams ability and overall tackle production is a big plus, but his draft stock might not match up with his elevated college production due to concerns over his quickness.	\N	51	5.32000000000000028	blake-martinez	\N
2555162	Deion	Jones	13	73	222	9.25	Jones' father, Cal, named his son after his favorite football player, Deion Sanders. His nickname has been "Debo", as in Deion and Bo, like Jackson, put together. The New Orleans native is living up to the expectations, winning the Metro Defensive Player of the Year as a senior in high school and eventually starring for his home state LSU Tigers. Jones had to be patient, though, as his first three years in Baton Rouge resulted in exactly one start (due to an injury to Kwon Alexander). He played primarily on special teams in 2012 (23 tackles, three for loss) and 2013 (15 tackles) before seeing more time on defense as a junior (27 tackles, 3.5 for loss). Then came Jones? chance to start with Alexander moving on to the NFL. He became permanent team captain and defensive MVP after leading the team with 100 tackles and 13.5 tackles for loss. He also had five sacks, two interceptions, and three pass breakups, showing scouts an all-around skill set giving him a shot to play at the next level.	High-twitch, well-muscled athlete with tapered waist and powerful trunk. Quick lateral slide from gap-to-gap mirroring running back. Speed to chase from sideline to sideline. Accelerates off his spot and into his target preferring to wrap up and drive hips through the tackle. Brings pop behind his pads. Trustworthy. Handles his run fits and isn?t looking to be a hero. Bouncy feet enable sudden change of direction. Willing to step into hole and deliver a blow to pulling guards or iso ­blocks. Has strength at point of attack to squeeze the edge against tight ends. Able to defend passes or pick them off in coverage. Special teams demon on cover teams. Maintained focus and team-­first attitude despite being unable to crack starting lineup until his senior season.	Only one year of starting experience. Slightly undersized. Tightly bundled frame may leave little room for additional mass on his frame. Needs to be diligent with hands or he can be engulfed by second level maulers. Diagnoses well, but instincts inside the flow of play are a work in progress. Needs to improve consistency as a tackler. Not as downhill as he could be limiting his production on tackles for losses. Loses track of his coverage in space from time to time. Showed some signs of fatigue in fourth quarter against tempo-­based teams.	Joe Mays	Three-down linebacker prospect with outstanding athleticism and a willing, aggressive mindset for the position. Jones lacks the playing experience that most linebackers in this draft will have so he might need a year of tutelage on the NFL level to help him expedite his learning curve. Jones could be a fit at ILB for a 3-4 team or as an outside linebacker in a 4­-3.

2555163	Eric	Striker	13	71	227	10.125	Each year there is a highly productive but undersized linebacker prospect in the draft, and the question is always the same -- "is he too small?" An NFL team will find room for Striker because of his explosiveness to the ball; ironically, he grew up in Tampa watching a Buccaneers defense that would have valued his speed and tenacity despite his size. He garnered first-team All-Big 12 and Associated Press All-American notice as both a junior (third team) and senior (second team). In his three years as a starter, Striker lived in opponents? backfields, racking up 46.5 tackles for loss and 23 sacks, while also hustling in coverage to defend 12 passes.	Chess piece Oklahoma defensive coordinators moved around the board. Excellent chase speed from backside with ability to shut down run play before it gets started. Plays with good bend and forward lean. Flexible ankles allow him to lean and trim edge sharply. Shows blockers unorthodox angles making it hard to get a solid punch on him as pass rusher. Flips hips and shoulders to squirm over top of a soft edge block and around the corner. Coordinates hands and feet to improve positioning after contact rather than laying on blocks. Fluid dropping into space and handles his business in coverage. Instinctive and aware in space and mindful to restrict passing windows. Proactive hand use and attempts to win early against larger, longer opponents. Able to snap off multiple direction changes while stalking prey.	Thin frame missing the sand in his pants to play full-­time on the edge. Below average play strength. Can?t consistently set an edge. Will get pushed around at the point of attack by physical tight ends. Doesn't have back-­end range to play full­-time safety role. Teams must have a plan for him or he could be miscast. Carries little pop behind his pads as tackler and isn't always tackle ready. Allowed four broken tackles on the season. Pass rush success reliant upon quickness over skill. If early edge burst gets shut down as pass rusher, doesn?t have consistent counter to go to. Gets jolted off-­course by a solid punch. Chase­-oriented tackler who has issues when teams come downhill at him. Has issues with losing contain against the run.	Tony Jefferson	Full-time, three­-year starter who has shown the ability to rush the passer, and cover in space. Striker's production was good, but not overly prolific and he doesn't appear to be a clean fit at the outside linebacker spot where he played in college. While teams could consider Striker as a 4­-3 WILL linebacker or as a box safety, he is most likely to appeal to teams who are looking to deploy him from a variety of spots on the field.	\N	17	5.41000000000000014	eric-striker	\N
2555164	Gionni	Paul	13	70	231	8.125	So how does a Florida kid playing for Miami end up in Utah? Well, he struggled off the field for the Hurricanes (where he started seven games as a sophomore, making 61 tackles, 3.5 for loss) and decided he would try to play for former Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson, with whom he built a relationship during his recruiting process. Erickson had moved on from Tempe to Salt Lake City, as an assistant, but that didn?t dissuade Paul. In his first year with the Utes, he picked off four passes in just seven games, and his season ended prematurely due to injury (broken foot, hand). Paul's play as a senior, however, cemented his status as an NFL prospect, earning first team All-Pac-12 honors with the second-best tackle total in the conference (109), four interceptions, three fumble recoveries (returning one for a score), and a team-leading 12.5 tackles for loss.	Bright person and player. Has two degrees from Utah. Teammates have gushed over his enthusiasm and energy in the weight room and in practice. Rarely overruns a cutback lane. Flows to the ball from inside/out maintaining a leveraged position to the sideline. Does a good job of mirroring running backs anticipating their running lane choices. Takes smart angles. Able to weave and sift through traffic in pursuit of his target. Heads­up, form tackler against downhill runs. Natural feel in pass coverage with four interceptions this season. Instinctive and consistently productive throughout his career.	Paul says he transferred from Miami, in part, because ?fast life got to me." Extremely undersized for an inside spot and has little chance of staying there as a pro. Has burst to the ball, but not overly athletic. Needs to play with better knee bend in space. Upright on the move and is unable to change direction as fluidly as needed. Below-average play strength limits success at point of attack. Technique broke down when he fatigued. Size/strength deficiencies will require above-average technique at all times as a pro. Doesn?t have strength in his legs or enough reactive athleticism to recover when offensive linemen get their hands on him.	John Timu	The scouting community is very concerned with Paul, and he is expected to measure much smaller than his listed size. However, as a pure football player, Paul has outstanding instincts, finds the best path to the football and can be effective against the run or pass. While he may be too small to play inside, his talent should find a roster spot for him at some point.	"He's small, but he's a good football player. Here's the thing­ -- he had big off­-field issues that helped run him out of Miami, and I think he's a red­-flagged character guy pure and simple. Hard to get drafted when you're small and have concerns about your character." ­-- NFC Pac-12 scout	80	5.11000000000000032	gionni-paul	\N
2555165	James	Burgess	12	71	227	\N	Don't let Burgess' size fool you -- he drills ball carriers into the ground. The Miami native is explosive to the play and brings bad intentions, especially when he has someone lined up in the backfield (10 tackles for loss in 2014, 9.5 in 2015). But the 2015 third-team All-ACC honoree also shows a knack for reading quarterbacks and making plays on the ball, with seven career interceptions and 13 pass breakups. Burgess also has NFL genes, with his father, James, Sr. a Miami alum and two-year player for the San Diego Chargers. His uncle, Willie Middlebrooks, was a first-round pick for the Broncos and also played in the CFL.	Good acceleration from a standstill. Reads quarterback?s eyes and accelerates into the passing lane to defend the pass. Batted down two Jameis Winston throws and intercepted another in 2014. Has 19 passes defensed over last three years. Fast flow to the football and able to outrace linemen looking to cut him off. Can make himself skinny and shoot downhill making tackles for losses. Has athleticism to change direction quickly and re­ignite his pursuit. Talented in man coverage with ability to run downfield with running backs. Made one-­handed snag of a Deshaun Watson pass this year.	Small for the position with questionable play toughness. Lack of physicality against the run showed up with 12 broken tackles and 32 missed tackles during three years as starter. Lacks decisiveness and play strength in attacking runs between the tackles. Run around linebacker losing gap leverage because of it. Too easily engulfed by linemen. Able to flow quickly to the ball when he diagnoses it, but his instincts are marginal at best. Will go under blocks and lose pursuit angles. Average awareness in space as zone defender.	\N	Three-year starter lacking the size and toughness to win against the run, but above average production and man cover talent against the pass. The tape shows a player who is too often confused and out of position to be relied upon as a starter, but his pursuit speed and ability in the passing game gives him a shot at making a roster as an outside linebacker if he can prove to be a special teams winner.	\N	59	5	james-burgess	\N
2555166	Joe	Schobert	13	73	244	9.75	Wisconsin has a storied walk-on tradition, producing NFL players like J.J. Watt and Jim Leonhard; Schobert hopes to be the next non-scholarship signee to jump to the NFL. He nearly began his career at North Dakota as a walk-on, but the Badger coaches wised up to offer him a spot on the team. Schobert's role grew each season, from reserve as a true freshman to key reserve (24 tackles, one start) in 2013 to consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten pick (13.5 tackles for loss) in his junior year. His draft stock rose to new heights in 2015, as he was named second-team All-American by USA Today and the Associated Press, as well as the Big Ten Linebacker of the Year and first-team All-Conference. He finished among the nation?s leaders in sacks (9.5) and tackles for loss (19.5), displaying the strength and motor to earn a spot in the NFL.	Very productive over his two years as a starter forcing six fumbles, recovering three, defending 10 passes and adding an interception as well. Slippery in his movements using good hip and upper body turn. Can get skinny and slide through gaps and around corners. Excellent with his hands helping him compensate for lack of play strength. Discards tight ends fairly quickly. Sees through blockers and into backfield maintaining sight on the ball. Can trim edge as rusher with shoulder dip. Assignment-­oriented in coverage making sure to redirect tight ends and receivers before dropping into space. Adequate man cover skills. Plays with plus balance and is rarely on the ground. Quality special teams cover man.	Doesn?t possess the overall size or length NFL teams look for on the edge. Lacks quick twitch and bend to alter his path suddenly. Forced to make tackle attempts from tough angles due to average athleticism. Rarely bodies up and struggles to finish as a tackler with 18 missed tackles over last two seasons including 10 this year. Lacking strength to set a strong edge. Will get blown off of his spot by tackles. Not a menacing one-­on­-one pass rusher. Average burst upfield. Much of his production as pass rusher comes from twists and extended plays. Below average play speed.	Jermauria Rasco	Some teams covet traits while others are mindful of production. Schobert won't excite any teams with his physical traits, but he has a way of finding the football and filling up a stat sheet. Schobert's lack of length and edge strength will make it tough for him to find a home as a 3­-4 outside linebacker, but his instincts might give him a chance as a WILL linebacker in a 3­-4. Regardless, his work on special teams will definitely improve his stock.	\N	40	5.37000000000000011	joe-schobert	\N
2555167	Josh	Forrest	12	75	249	9.5	Although Forrest didn't play football until his junior year of high school, he did enough there (14 touchdowns receiving, seven interceptions -- three returned for touchdowns) to earn a scholarship from the Wildcats. After two years as a reserve, Forrest took over as a starter, leading the team in tackles in each of the past two seasons (110 in 2014, 93 in 2015). He also made plays in the passing game, intercepting two passes each year (including a 81-yard pick six against Louisville this year).	Tall, long­-limbed and athletic. Was used all over the field by Kentucky staff. Has 202 tackles during his two-year stint as starter. Has plus chase speed. Lateral quickness is a strength. Length and closing burst gives him extended range to make tackles. Has quick direction change to put himself in position for difficult open field finishes. Uses hand and foot quickness to side­step and brush away blockers targeting him on second level. Frequently used as blitzer and gap shooter. Able to "get skinny" and sneak through crevices and into the backfield.	Could use more strength in his lower half. Needs to add play strength to avoid being washed down against run. Physical tight ends can push him at point of attack. Too upright on downhill charges and blitzes. Gets jostled out of the play by redirect blocks. Effort runs hot and cold. As tackler, below average job of breaking down in space. Relies on catch-­and-­drag technique over chesting up and finishing. Had nine broken and 22 missed tackles over last two years. Slow to diagnose and gets few head starts on the play. Average awareness in pass coverage and needs to get better at squeezing targets in his zone.	\N	With his athleticism and length, teams may be tempted to try him out as an edge rusher, but he is a much better straight-­line blitzer through the A and B gaps than he is around the edge. Forrest is a WILL linebacker with the size and range teams look for, but his combination of average instincts and wasted movement in space could be an indicator of up-­and-­down play in the pros.	\N	84	5.28000000000000025	josh-forrest	\N
2555168	Kentrell	Brothers	13	72	245	9.75	Undersized for an inside 'backer (a potential factor in the lack of interest by major programs in his home state of Oklahoma), Brothers recognizes plays quickly, works his way through traffic, and flows down the line very effectively as a run-stopper. His junior year was impressive (122 total tackles as a second-team All-SEC pick in 2014), but leading the nation in tackles per game (12.7, 152 total), making more plays in the backfield (12 tackles for loss) and proving himself able to make plays against the pass (two interceptions) and on special teams (three blocked kicks) made him an easy second-team All-American pick by the Associated Press and USA Today for 2015.	Elite vision and understanding of spatial relationship. Finds the ball quickly and rarely lets it leave his sights. Has innate sense of when to go over or under blocks and finds creases to tackle that many linebackers can?t see. Reads keys and allows them to lead him to victory. Calm and focused around line of scrimmage and is very rarely taken off his feet by a block. Plays with pre­-snap idea of where ball is headed and races to the spot ahead of linemen looking to climb up and block him. Well­-schooled in his hand play. Shoots a jarring punch into blockers and keeps himself clean to chase the steak. Finished with 42 more tackles than the next linebacker in the SEC. Gap responsible and has the play strength to stand up to blockers. Great finisher as tackler. His huge hands can turn a diving arm tackle into a finish. Sniffs out play-action and immediately looks for his coverage responsibility. Reads quarterbacks' clues to where pass is headed. Rarely busts in coverage responsibilities.	Stubby lower half with some tightness in his hips and short arms. Very average athlete and lacking quick-twitch expected from such a productive linebacker. Reactive athleticism near the line of scrimmage is just okay. Instincts have to be razor sharp because speed to the perimeter is below average. Feet don?t work as quickly as his mind does. At times, overestimates speed and will take a poor angle to the ball. More of an extra rusher than quality blitzer as a pass rusher. Scouts say coaches on staff have had concerns about his maturity in the past. Can be mismatched and beaten for a big play when asked to cover man­-to­-man down the field.	Paul Dawson	Really fun to watch on tape with many of the same play traits that made TCU?s Paul Dawson so productive last season. Brothers is a decisive, rhythm linebacker whose understanding of space and ability to improve his tackle positioning at the point of attack should make him a consistently productive inside linebacker in the pros. While Brothers will lack the speed and overall athleticism that some teams covet, it would be a huge mistake to value athleticism over instincts and production when evaluating Brothers.	\N	15	5.82000000000000028	kentrell-brothers	\N
2555169	Reggie	Ragland	12	73	247	9.875	The question heading into Ragland?s senior season wasn?t whether he would be a solid run-stuffer as a starting 3-4 inside linebacker in the NFL, as his play the past two falls secured that notion. He earned his spot as an elite prospect, though, with his play in 2015. He led the Tide with 97 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and broke up six passes, winning SEC Defensive Player of the Year, numerous All-American honors and landing finalist spots for multiple national awards. In fact, Ragland was the third Alabama player to earn unanimous All-American notice, joining Cornelius Bennett and Derrick Thomas. Ragland could have left for the NFL last year, but decided to come back to win a championship, get his degree, and continue his work in the community.	Old-school, take­-on middle linebacker who plays the game the way Nick Saban likes. Steps into hole and will swap paint with lead blockers in order to constrict his gap. Instinctive linebacker who trusts his eyes and goes. Showed greater understanding of angles and leverage this year. Won?t over­commit when flowing to ball carrier and almost always finds his run fits. Missed tackles fell from ten in 2014 to just three this season. Played with hand in ground as an edge rusher in some sub­packages. Showed greater willingness to take chances downhill. Nasty hitter with above average play strength.	Some scouts question his play speed. Can be inconsistent with his angles when playing downhill. Could get himself in trouble miscalculating NFL speed to the perimeter. Will get locked up more often by pro linemen if he tries to take on all blocks rather than punch and shed. Alabama?s outstanding defensive front allowed him to roam unblocked for much of the year. Can handle himself in zone coverage but man cover skills are limited.	E.J. Henderson	Thumping inside linebacker with throwback size and tone­setting mentality. Ragland is a confident and capable early starter in league who has the temperament to become one of the premier run­-stopping inside linebackers in the pro game. Ragland has some coverage and speed limitations, but his instincts and overall awareness should be able to mask those issues.	"He's a throwback linebacker, but he's going to get drafted in the first (round) because he has rush ability, too." -- Former NFC scouting director	88	6.50999999999999979	reggie-ragland	\N
2555170	Terrance	Smith	12	75	235	9.875	Smith's father, Terry, was a star receiver at Clemson and the story of his passing will be discussed often going into the draft. But scouts only really care about the abilities of the young man who earned second-team All-ACC accolades in 2014 (87 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two interceptions) on the outside by using his height and length to attack plays in the backfield and to the sideline. Terrance also has experience playing the middle for the Seminoles. Smith missed four games with an ankle injury in 2015, but league media still gave him honorable mention notice for his play (65 tackles, 4.5 for loss).	Long linebacker with very good athletic ability. Lowers pad level to improve leverage when taking on blockers. Instinctive and responsible in his play against the run. Won?t usually over-­pursue and takes quality angles to the ball making adjustments for blockers and running back speed. Plays with outstanding pursuit speed and looks at home when he?s chasing. Can range from sideline to sideline. Closing burst gives him potential as a blitzer. Showed resilience coming back to play at a high level after missing time due to high ankle sprain. Football bloodlines. Father was a standout receiver at Clemson and DeAndre Hopkins is his cousin.	Frame might be too thin to play inside. Plays upright after the snap hovering towards the ball rather than aggressively scraping. Needs to be better at playing with squared pads. Waits on second level rather than attacking downhill. Had relatively low number of tackles for losses during his time with Seminoles. Very little bang behind his pads. Wildly inconsistent tackler with 24 missed tackles over last two years. Drifts in coverage and doesn?t play with same instincts he shows against run. Had no passes defensed this year. Took medical redshirt in 2011, missed two games with neck injury in 2014 and four games this year with high ankle sprain.	Telvin Smith	Tall linebacker who could play inside in a 3-4 or outside in a 4­-3. Smith has the chase speed to be a factor all over the field, but the production doesn?t match up with the athleticism. Smith doesn?t have the play strength to consistently finish as a tackler and he shows a surprising lack of tackles for loss considering his speed and the defensive linemen he has played behind. As a former sprinter and jumper in high school, Smith should star at the combine which could get him drafted ahead of where his production says he should go.	\N	3	5.38999999999999968	terrance-smith	\N
2555171	Tyler	Matakevich	13	72	238	9.5	The 2015 Bronco Nagurski Award winner and three-time first-team All-American Athletic Conference pick isn't the biggest player on the field but is usually among the most productive. This four-year starter in the middle accumulated over 100 tackles in each season for the Owls, totaling 493 for his career. In his sophomore year, he led the nation with 8.8 solo tackles a game. And his tackles aren't just catching ball carriers after they?ve gone through the hole, as he's had 40 stops behind the line of scrimmage. Add in five interceptions and five pass breakups during his award-winning senior campaign, and it appears there's not much Matakevich can't do.	Considered a great teammate and leader. Incredible production over all four years as a starter. Finished regular season with 465 total tackles including over 100 each season. Has great eyes and processes what they tell him quickly. Decisive with instinctive recognition of play flow and and shuffles accordingly. Keys the quarterback?s eyes and gets a head start into space on pass plays. Rarely fooled by play-action. Plays square to the line of scrimmage and keeps eyes glued to the ball against the run. Battles his limitations by attacking downhill and shooting gaps to disrupt in the backfield. Can shift from a downhill path to lateral movement seamlessly. Easy turn and move into space against the pass. Uses active hands to challenge and defend throws.	Play strength is very average. Can be engulfed by linemen on the second level and might not have the frame to carry more functional mass. Struggles to hold his spot in the grass against a good lead block. Gets in a hurry to flow downhill and runs himself into bad angles on the ball when the play spills outside. Needs to do a more consistent job of breaking down in space before attempting to tackle. Shifty runners turn him into an arm tackler. Had 32 missed tackles over the last three seasons. Gets caught up in trash near the line of scrimmage and can?t get free quickly. Play speed is average.	A.J. Klein	Film junkie who understands that maximum preparation is essential to his production and success. Matakevich has outstanding instincts paired with a desire to fill up a stat sheet with as many positive plays as possible. His lack of size and strength may limit him to a 4-­3 WILL linebacker spot only. His work ethic, production and ability to step right in and help on special teams gives him a shot at having a long career as a mid­-level starter in the league.	"Not big, not fast and not strong. Hard to make it as an NFL linebacker without those elements. With that said, the kid makes a bunch of plays. Production matters and he has it." -- AFC North Executive	27	5.25	tyler-matakevich	\N
2555172	Briean	Boddy-Calhoun	14	69	193	9.125	The Gophers lined up two of the top corners in the country the past couple of seasons with Eric Murray and Boddy-Calhoun, a junior college transfer (Coffeyville) who was tabbed for All-Big Ten accolades each of the last two seasons. In 2014, league media voted him first-team All-Conference (coaches had him on their second team) just one season after tearing his left ACL as he picked off five passes and broke up nine. Boddy-Calhoun intercepted four more passes in 2015, breaking up six others, to garner third-team All-Conference from the media (honorable mention from coaches).	Smooth hips that open easily. Confident in his feet out of press and rarely gets turned around by a shifty release. Can bail from press coverage with little to no delay. High school high jumper who has the spring to make up for his lack of height. When he?s in position, can be effective playing the ball. Flashed greater potential in 2014. In zone or off coverage, can stick a foot in the ground instantly to drive forward. Not overly grabby. Flagged just one time in 2015.	Small in stature and lacking a ?dog mentality? to make up for his lack of size. Marginal athleticism for the position and unable to carry long speed down the field. Gives away too much space in off-­man coverage. Play dipped from 2014 and there were games where he looked completely unable to squeeze routes effectively. Diagnoses throws quickly but missing burst to put himself into playmaking position. Gets overwhelmed by size in red zone. Gave up a whopping six touchdowns in 2015. Tackling in the pros could be a major issue.	\N	Small cornerback who played outside and from the slot, but must become a full­-time slot cornerback on the next level due to his lack of size and strength. Boddy­-Calhoun allowed entirely too much separation at times and he has a difficult time mustering enough closing speed when beaten over the top. His lack of traits could push him down the draft boards so he needs to have a big postseason to keep his draft stock alive.	\N	35	4.95000000000000018	briean-boddy-calhoun	\N
2555173	Eric	Murray	14	71	199	\N	Murray's size, durability (started 39 straight games) and physical nature should land him near the top of NFL teams' cornerback wish list. The 2014 second-team and 2015 third-team All-Big Ten selection's experience in press man coverage is extensive, and his ball skills are good enough to make plays (two interceptions, 24 pass break-ups) when given the opportunity. He stepped up his play as a senior, making more plays behind the line (four tackles for loss) and lining up ball carriers for the big hit, forcing three fumbles. He's also a special-teams stalwart who blocked two punts in 2014, which will only increase his impact as a rookie on Sundays.	Plays with excellent technique when running vertically with wideouts. Maintains good positioning and crowds receiver's chest forcing him against the sideline. Looks to smother any and every route underneath from press ­man coverage. Talented in trial technique. Uses a quick jab to the shoulder that can be very effective on unsuspecting targets. Not content to ride blocks and battles to get to a tackle in his area. Disciplined in zone coverage. Able to maintain focus on quarterback and wide receiver. Will look to make a play outside his area if he thinks he can jump the throw. Adequate close­out burst to the ball.	Tight in his hips with a labored transition from press coverage. Tightness causes momentary stalling when changing directions laterally putting him behind in his coverage. Let?s weight drift outside his framework causing balance issues. Needs to widen base a little to improve his balance. Top-end speed looks average on tape. Doesn?t have mentality of a small cornerback but his size is a detriment outside. Can be locked down by big, physical receivers when attempting to do his part against the run.	\N	Too small to play outside, but has enough cover skills and toughness against the run to make it in the league as a slot cornerback. Murray's instincts and vision serve him well in zone coverage, which might be where he is at his best, but he shouldn?t be considered limited to just zone­-based defenses. He will be challenged by quality quarterback play at the Senior Bowl and a good week there could solidify him in the middle rounds.	\N	35	5.41999999999999993	eric-murray	\N
2555391	Brandon	Wilds	2	73	220	10.25	Wilds found himself on the field more quickly than most anticipated in his true freshman season, as multiple injuries at running back (including stud Marcus Lattimore) put him in the spotlight. He reached 100 yards in three of his five starts that year (finishing with 486 rush yards, three TD; 15-136 receiving). But Wilds' luck turned, and he was the one fighting off injuries throughout the rest of his career. A high-ankle sprain knocked him out for the entire 2012 season, while hamstring and elbow injuries limited him to seven games and two starts in 2013 (221 rush yards, three TD). He also suffered through knee and shoulder injuries as a junior but managed 570 rushing yards and four touchdowns (along with 18-143, one TD receiving). Even in his senior campaign, Wilds missed three games with bruised ribs but still led the team with 567 yards in nine starts.	Good size with bulk and willingness to block on third downs. Has some late cutback ability against second level linebackers. Looked comfortable in downhill, power scheme over off­set, inside zone scheme. Lowers shoulder into contact and continues to run his feet. Can absorb a blow and fall forward behind his pads. Proved to be functional in pass game with screens, swing passes and basic routes out of backfield.	One­-note runner without the burst or wiggle to sneak through closing running lanes. Limited by scheme-fit. Not suited for one-­cut running. Balance is below average and doesn?t have the speed to turn the corner against NFL linebackers. Tries to finish runs prematurely. Hands are just average as a pass catcher and will fall prey to occasional focus drops. Unpredictable in his response to blitz in protection.	\N	Provided decent production during his run at South Carolina, but he never became the go­-to chain mover that South Carolina hoped he might become. Wilds runs hard and will usually get what?s blocked, but he's lacking the creativity or athleticism to transcend his South Carolina tape.	\N	85	4.94000000000000039	brandon-wilds	\N
2555175	James	Bradberry	14	73	211	9.125	Bradberry signed with Arkansas State out of high school, but since the team desired him to move to safety during his redshirt year there, he decided to transfer to Samford to play outside. He's been a four-year starter for the Bulldogs, and was named second-team All-Southern Conference as a junior (two interceptions, four pass breakups) and the first team in 2015 (two interceptions, 11 breakups). Will he stay at cornerback in the NFL, or will teams ask him to switch to safety?	Well built with the size that defensive coordinators look for from NFL cornerbacks. Plays with adequate lateral quickness and reactive athleticism when transitioning forward. Drives hard to the throw looking to make a play on the ball at the catch point. Long arms with ability to aggressively jam and redirect receivers off the snap. Uses length and size to trap receivers against the sideline from press. Plus ball tracking ability on downfield throws. Looks comfortable in zone coverage with feel for routes that are developing around him. Rarely out of position as run supporter. Will use sideline as his ally against run and is diligent with containment on the perimeter.	Base and balance need quite a bit of work from press coverage. Below average, clunky footwork transitioning from press into coverage. Looks unsure of himself against receivers with initial quickness off the snap. Has issues maintaining feel against inside release and gives up too much separation to start the rep. Gets turned too easily in coverage and is sluggish in his change of direction. Gets too locked in on man in front of him and doesn't show innate awareness and instincts. Might not be able to transition to safety. Appears lacking in alpha aggressiveness. In run support, ducks head into contact and doesn't drive through the target. Need to see more hustle and less complacency from him on backside. Waits too long to rally to the ball when it is away from him.	\N	Long, well-built cornerback who plays with enough ball skills to interest teams. On tape, Bradberry shows consistent issues with his footwork from press coverage and gives up too much separation to quick receivers early in routes. A step up in competition may be challenging for him early on and despite his size, his best spot may be as a zone corner.	"I'm hearing his name come up quite a bit on the road. Anytime a corner looks the part physically, he's going to get plenty of attention because those guys are still fairly rare in our league. Can he play?

2555176	Lloyd	Carrington	14	70	190	\N	The Dallas native followed head coach Todd Graham from Pitt to Arizona State after his freshman season, and the move has paid dividends. Carrington earned honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades (58 tackles, six for loss, one interception, five pass break-ups) in just his fourth year at cornerback -- he didn't play high school football until his senior season. He repeated those honors in 2015 (53 tackles, one interception, six pass break-ups). Don't be surprised if gets compared to inexperienced-basketball player-turned-stud-cornerback Quentin Rollins from the 2015 draft class.	Former high school basketball guard who plays with decent lateral foot quickness and recovery skills. Still growing in understanding of position after playing just one year of high school football. Has ability to time leaps and challenge at the high point. Able to fight through blockers for his chance at a tackle on the perimeter. Was a gunner on special teams and also covered kicks.	Allows too much separation off press coverage and receivers can beat him inside too easily. Only three interceptions to 10 touchdowns allowed during his career. Lacks burst to the ball needed to attack throws at the catch point. Inconsistent finisher as tackler. Shows signs of panic when he senses he is being beaten over the top. Grabby in man coverage downfield. Doesn?t have the top end speed to run receivers down. Takes bad angles to ball when preparing to tackle which cost his team 95- and 75-yard touchdowns.	\N	Carrington got a late jump on high school football and is still playing catch­up on the field. While he had some struggles last year, he was expected to show vast improvement this season, but that didn?t materialize. There are times he will flash, but his inconsistent angles to the ball and lack of closing speed could make him a late, day three selection at best with more seasoning needed.	\N	45	4.90000000000000036	lloyd-carrington	\N
2555177	Mackensie	Alexander	14	70	190	9.125	One of the most highly sought-after recruits in Clemson history, Alexander was ranked the fourth-best prospect in the country by ESPN coming out of high school. His work ethic and football acumen would have gotten him on the field as a true freshman in 2013 season, but he redshirted instead with a groin injury. Once Alexander got on the field, opponents found out why he was rated so highly. In 2014, he was named Freshman All-American and honorable mention All-ACC honors as a full-time starter. As a redshirt sophomore, he earned third-team All-American and first-team all-conference notice for locking down receivers. In fact, his lack of statistical production over the past two years (no interceptions, 11 pass breakups in 2014-2015) shows how little opponents challenged him.	Fiery competitor who is quick to mix it up with a receiver after the play. Extremely confident and shows signs of being able to rise to the occasion against elevated competition. Allowed just 29.6 percent completions and no touchdowns. Got the best of OU wide receiver Sterling Shepard in back-to-back seasons. Smaller, but well built with good muscular definition. Able to read wide receivers and gain a head start on their plans. Goes to work in the film room. Reacts quickly to what he sees. Has very good recovery quickness within the first 10 yards to close out any early separation. Showed improved technique as season progressed. Loves to trap and crowd outside releases against the sideline. When he learns to play ball over man, his passes defensed will jump. Plays stronger than his size and his demeanor fires up his teammates.	Shorter than teams like for cornerbacks outside and will have his hands full with NFL size outside. When bailing in coverage, needs to make sure to stay within play range of wide receiver. Can get too caught up in trash ­talking. Production numbers lower than expected. During two­-year stint with Clemson had no interceptions and just ten total passes defensed. Relies on reactive quickness over quality footwork. A little frenetic opening up from press coverage and could struggle against a crafty, NFL release until he gains more experience.	Desmond Trufant	Alexander is a difficult evaluation because there are times on tape that he looks vulnerable to quickness off the line of scrimmage and he doesn?t have the prototypical size of a top­-end NFL cornerback. However, he was consistently sticky in man coverage and played with the instincts and confidence needed from a true cover corner. Alexander's confidence may border on cockiness at times, but that also seems to feed his competitive fire. Alexander might struggle early on, but should settle in to become a quality starter by his second year.	\N	1	5.98000000000000043	mackensie-alexander	\N
2555178	Maurice	Canady	14	73	193	9.125	There's a lot to like about Virginia's next cornerback prospect: He's tall (listed at 6-foot-2), has long arms to knock away passes from receivers (18 pass breakups in 2014-2015), and flashes hands to snatch low or high errant passes (three interceptions as a junior). He also has returned punts for scores during his career, including one for a 74-yard score against William and Mary this fall. If scouts believe Canady can wrap up ball carriers and get them to the ground, he'll move up draft boards like former tall Cavs corners Ras-I Dowling and Chris Cook did before him.	Above average height for the position. Has experience playing from slot and outside. Light on his feet. Relatively smooth hip turn and foot quickness to mirror and match the receiver. Plays with desired balance and body control for lateral change of direction. Good short area ball reaction. More disciplined in his play this season after giving up too many big plays in 2014. Instinctive and shows tendency recognition that comes from film study and retention of coaching. Leary of double moves. Processes quickly. Plays with adequate transitional quickness to react to what is eyes are seeing.	Scouts concerned about ability to carry long speed. Torched for six touchdowns in 2014. Opens out of backpedal extremely early for fear of being beaten over the top. Ball production (passes defensed and interceptions) plummeted in 2015 showing fear of playing tight. No interceptions this season. Played so far off receivers that challenging throws became impossible. Tall, tight backpedal. Doesn?t have juice to quickly close separation when asked to turn and run. Unable to find ball frequently when beaten over the top. Lightweight. Pushed around in the red zone by bigger targets. Ankle­-biter as tackler with inconsistent effort and desire. Passed up opportunities to stick his nose in.	Tye Smith	Canady has the size and athleticism to be an NFL cornerback, but it is hard to ignore the disparity in touchdowns allowed (10) versus interceptions (three) over the last two seasons. Canady's long speed and toughness are going to be heavily scrutinized during the draft process, but he has enough talent to be an NFL backup.	"He's soft. He has talent, but I have serious doubts about whether or not he's physically tough enough and mentally tough enough. Teams would runs screens at him because they knew he might not challenge the play. At least he was a playmaker in 2014." ­-- AFC scout in charge of ACC	8	5.29999999999999982	maurice-canady	\N
2555179	William	Jackson III	14	72	189	9.25	Jackson started his career at Trinity Valley Junior College, and found himself a regular starter by the end of his first year with the Cougars in 2013. He stepped up his game as a junior to become a second-team American Athletic Conference pick (two interceptions, 10 pass breakups), ranking among the national leaders in pass breakups before suffering a sprained MCL late in the year. Jackson tweaked a knee during 2015, but started 12 of 13 games, again was named second-team all-conference and finished with five interceptions and 23 pass breakups, leading the nation in passes defended.	Good height and length. Stays low from a smooth backpedal. Plays with capable makeup speed when receivers get separation. Can click and close on throws in front of him with acceleration and has makeup speed deep. Possesses ball skills that defensive back coaches covet. Gets his head around to find ball on downfield throws and has excellent disruptive timing when attacking the throw. Instinctive and quick to diagnose and react to his keys. Allowed just 40 percent of passes thrown his way to be completed over last two years. Has feel for routes and will adjust coverage accordingly. Had three interceptions and scored two defensive touchdowns this season.	Average play strength and isn't as physical from press coverage as he could be. Might be knocked around by big NFL receivers if he's asked to press. Will get upright when transitioning from backpedal. Shows momentary delay when opening to run which can put him behind in footrace with speedy receivers. Tape shows instance of him getting knocked off balance at the top of the route. Will get hung up on perimeter blocks and isn't aggressive in run support. Too willing to run around block in support against screens. Was flagged seven times for 73 yards.	Phillip Gaines	Tall cornerbacks with length who can run and play the football are usually in high demand and that could be the case for Jackson as well. While he has the traits for the position, the league is turning into small and fast or big and strong at the receiver spot and handling those two elements could take a year or two for him to improve in before he becomes a full-­time starter.	\N	58	5.79999999999999982	william-jackson iii	\N
2555180	Austin	Blythe	8	74	291	9.375	In the sports world, Iowa is primarily known for two things: producing NFL offensive linemen and high-level wrestling. Blythe, a Williamsburg, Iowa native, is a perfect example of how those things go hand-in-hand. He was a two-time all-state pick in football (123 career tackles, 40 for loss, 14 sacks) and three straight heavyweight wresting titles (setting a state record with 143 pins) in a state that takes the sport very seriously. He put those skills to use in his redshirt freshman season, starting nine games at right guard but missing two due to injury. Blythe didn?t miss any more games during his three final years with the Hawkeyes, starting all 40 games at center. He gained recognition for his play each year, garnering consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a sophomore and second team All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches in 2014 and 2015. Blythe was even named as a Rimington Trophy finalist this season.	Four-year starter featuring durability and leadership qualities. Has played center and both guard spots which gives him a mental head­start. Controlled glider up to inside linebackers and plays with plus body control. Patient, confident run blocker who consistently lands his blocks in the center of his targets. Keeps his feet grinding after contact to generate movement and prolonged engagement as a blocker. Sticks to opponents like a shadow and is always bodied up near his man. Excellent outside zone blocker. Uses feet and upper body strength to run gap­-shooters up the field past the quarterback. The Hawkeyes love pulling him and using as lead blocker in space. Technician able to snap and step quickly on reach blocks. Sinks hips and can anchor up against bull rushers. Good functional strength for his size. Played in over 96 percent of team?s offensive snaps over last three years.	Undersized by every standard that NFL teams use for centers. Lack of length and mass is a legitimate concern moving forward. Has played both guard spots and center, but size likely limits him to center only in the league. Teams may view him as fit for zone specific teams which could limit his draft stock. Catches pass rushers rather than punching. Will have to adjust to defensive tackles using length to disrupt his task. Tape shows potential mental mistakes in protection against blitzes.	Matt Paradis	Played with consistency throughout his stint as a four-year starter at Iowa and his 2015 tape is solid from start to finish. While his lack of physical traits could hurt where he is taken in the draft, his functional strength, technical savvy, athleticism and body control should not be ignored as he has all the makings of an eventual NFL starter.	\N	32	5.24000000000000021	austin-blythe	\N
2555181	Evan	Boehm	8	74	309	10.25	One of the top offensive line recruits in the country coming out of high school, Boehm stepped right onto the field for the Tigers in 2012 -- and hasn?t left the lineup since. He started 52 straight games for head coach Gary Pinkel, playing freshman year at left guard and then three straight years in the pivot. Boehm is a thick interior lineman who has a strong anchor and can move his feet well for the position, portending a long NFL career.	Iron man. Holds school record for consecutive starts. Suffered high­-ankle sprain in the first game of the year, but was right back on the field the next game. Rare power from a center. Phone booth champ. Able to consistently generate push at initial point of attack and take control of the neutral zone. Runs his feet under him at contact and drives the sled while staying glued to his man. Tough and smart. Quickly processes double A-­gap looks and responds successfully. Has power to redirect when beaten on the edge. Owns the A-­gap versus blitzes and stunts. Keeps head from ducking in on pass sets and will punch and re­set hands, when needed, to maintain positioning. Comes from a football family and father was a highly successful high school coach. Rarely bull­-rushed. Looks for work when he?s uncovered against pass rush.	Squatty frame with short legs. Doesn't have the height or arm length that many teams require from draftable centers inside the first four rounds. Much better straight line mover than laterally. Gets straight-legged on second level and when engaging laterally creating inconsistent contact balance. Reliant on upper body strength over lower body movement which could make securing reach blocks a challenge on the NFL level. Has physical limitations outside his compact frame. While he has some post-­snap athleticism in short spaces, his restricted stride length slows him when asked to get out in space.	Corey Linsley	Four­-year starter with outstanding power at the point of attack with an ability to create running lanes through sheer brute force. Boehm?s squatty frame may cause some evaluators to hesitate, but offensive line coaches will fall in love with his instincts, power, leadership and durability. Boehm has a chance to be an early starter for a team looking for power and leadership in the middle of their line.	"He's tough as nails. He'll play with pain and he's the kind of guy who can command a locker room. I always look for talent first, but leadership might be just as important from your center and he has that." ­ -- NFC West executive	15	5.41999999999999993	evan-boehm	\N
2555182	Graham	Glasgow	8	78	307	10.75	Left guard, right guard, center: wherever he lines up, Glasgow is a tough blocker that shows enough mobility to make creases for running backs. Glasgow started at right guard as a junior before moving into the pivot for 2015 after incumbent Jack Miller ended his football career due to concussions. Glasgow's nine starts there in 2013 made it an easier move, allowing him to lead a rejuvenated Michigan offense and garner consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors with his play.	Has started as both a guard and center and offers roster depth at either position. Strong lower half. Adequate at sustaining blocks long enough for runners to hit the holes. Aggressive at the point of attack and looks to grind defenders off their spot with leg drive and upper body strength. Has the base anchor to stone a bull ­rush if he gets even average arm extension. Maintains good pocket depth in pass sets as both a guard and center. Tape gives hints of some mean. Praised for consistency by Jim Harbaugh and considered a leader on the team.	Snap-to-step quickness just average. Marginal athlete who plays with heavy feet. Below average at moving his feet and adjusting his path to block moving targets on the second level. Angles to second level blocks need work. Hands get too wide allowing defenders into his frame first on occasion. Shows issues with slow recognition of twists. Was arrested for driving under the influence in March of 2014 and had his probation extended for violation of alcohol during the probation period. Scouts are concerned with his off-­the­-field discipline with more free time available.	Oday Aboushi	Three-year starter who relies on power over athleticism to win his reps. Glasgow?s strength at the point of attack will appeal to power running teams, but his inconsistent connection percentage on second level blocks may worry some teams. Glasgow needs to improve his hands, but he has enough upside to be a quality backup at two positions or maybe an eventual starter.	"Well (Jim) Harbaugh has been good for him. He's not a great athlete but he?s got some power but it won't matter if teams don?t trust him because of his issues with drinking. I think Harbaugh kind of woke him up to how much he stands to lose. I don't see us pulling him off our boards for his background though." ­-- NFC Director of Scouting	33	5.5	graham-glasgow	\N
2555183	Jack	Allen	8	73	294	10.125	When an NFL offensive line coach sees that a young lineman was a high school wrestler, a smile comes across his face. Grappling in the trenches is what a lineman does -- and is something at which Allen excels. The former Illinois state title holder at 285 pounds is not the largest center in the country, but no other "man in the middle" matches this four-year starter's toughness, anchor, and aggressive nature. The two-time USA Today All-American missed a couple of games with an ankle injury in 2015, but came back to help his team to a Big Ten title.	Has a compact build with above average core strength. Was a standout wrestler in high school and uses that background to generate quick torques and turns on defenders. Understands his strengths and physical limitations. Possesses great strength in his hands and can snatch and ride defenders until the whistle sounds. Rarely has his hands outside defender's framework. Combines arm extension and running feet to redirect gap shooters away from his quarterback. Card­-carrying tough guy willing to put some extra spice on it when he finishes a block. On the move, can adjust tempo and angle to land a squared block. Climbs up to middle linebackers with choppy steps and balanced base. Despite a lack of athleticism, still has plus body control. Hits where he aims. Flat­-footed puncher in pass pro.	Average athleticism and very moderate flexibility. Is a little bit stiff in space. Inconsistent in his attempts to climb up to second level off of combo blocks. Will struggle to get cut­off blocks against instinctive, inside linebackers who will beat him to the spot. Able to get away with holding more often in college than he will be able to in the pros. At times, will rely on brute force over physical ability. When he has to anchor up against bull ­rushers, his balance diminishes. Doesn't have the mass or length that some teams would like in a starting center.	Olin Kreutz	Despite having a cat named "Bubbles," Allen is a coach's dream with the leadership, competitiveness and the tenacious mindset to grind out the will of defenders by the end of the fourth quarter. While there are clearly some athletic limitations, Allen is especially adept at minimizing those while accentuating his strengths. There are too many check marks in his favor to expect him to fall short of an NFL career as an eventual starter.	\N	34	5.50999999999999979	jack-allen	\N
2555184	Jake	Brendel	8	75	286	\N	Brendel brings everything you?d want in a center: leadership (three-time co-captain), intelligence (first-team Academic All-Conference pick), reliability (four-year starter), and production (second-team All-Pac-12 pick in 2014 and 2015). Brendel isn't as strong or athletic as some NFL teams prefer in the pivot, but others will value his other traits and willingness to get after his man in the run game enough to consider him a potential starter.	Co-­captain for three season and considered a "glue guy" on the offensive side of the ball. Uses quick steps and positioning to hook nose tackles and wall them off in the running game. Moves up to linebackers with measured, controlled steps. Gathers himself before second level engagement. Able to turn and steer defenders while on the move. Durable and reliable playing 92 percent of the Bruins' offensive snaps over four year span. Stood up to the power of Washington nose tackle Danny Shelton in 2014. In pass protection, usually keeps weight centered rather than letting it drift too far outside and has enough strength to handle bull rush. Shows some pop off the snap in run game. When pulling, takes smart angles to linebackers helping him to seal off the perimeter.	Small frame with unimpressive build. Lacks muscular definition and NFL­-level mass. Upright blocker with a pad level that gets him jostled. At times plays with wide, hugging hands to compensate for a lack of core strength. Overall athleticism is an issue. Doesn?t have the bend or feet to stop suddenly and change directions to catch up to a counter move. Reactive movement and body control are below average. Inconsistent at sustaining blocks due to marginal contact balance. Lack of arm length allows defenders to intrude on his frame and control the rep at times. Doesn?t appear to have the necessary athletic tools to be able to recover when beaten early on in the snap.	Reese Dismukes	Leadership, durability and an ability to battle it tight quarters are all admirable qualities for Brendel, but his lack of athleticism and consistency in space will be challenges for him when NFL teams pound the tape. Brendel doesn?t have the length or body type to play any position other than center so his journey to the NFL might be a challenge.	\N	52	4.92999999999999972	jake-brendel	\N
2555185	Joey	Hunt	8	72	295	\N	Hunt is an underrated member of a prolific TCU offense that ranked fifth and third in the country the past two years, respectively. The Texas all-state pick on offense and defense during his high school days, Hunt was destined to be a stalwart on the offensive lines for the Horned Frogs. After a freshman season that saw him play seven games, starting once at left guard, he moved to the pivot, where he led his team for three straight seasons (save one start at right guard against Texas in 2013). Even though Hunt did not start the final three games of his senior year due to injury, Big 12 coaches named him first-team all-conference. The previous year, he had garnered second-team All-Big 12 honors after starting all 13 games.	Scholar­-athlete who brings mental sharpness from classroom onto the field. Instinctive, efficient center. Will climb up to second level rather than linger on secure blocks that are already in the bag. Plays with proper base and mirrors inside linebacker movement on his way up to them on run plays. Quick, darting eyes to find incoming traffic when he senses twists. Plays with functional change of direction ability. Brings feet up under his hips to secure his block and can shuffle them into position while on the move to get defenders pinned. Shows surprising anchor for his size when under duress against bull­ rush. Flat-back posture in pass sets.	Undersized for the position. May not have much room for additional mass on his frame. Nose tackles with length can get into him and control the snap. Can improve balance at contact on second level. Despite a start at guard, his size makes him a one position player. Will face steep increase in strength in quickness from what he's seen in the Big 12. Gets grabby at times and holding penalties have found him more than they should this season. Short arms will always be a concern for him.	\N	Technically sound, three-year starter who plays with confidence and consistency. Hunt lacks the size and length that teams look for from draftable centers, but his football IQ, consistency and functional strength give him a shot.	"Not sure why, but he's been flying under the radar with scouts I talk to all year long. I like him. I think he can play in our league." --­ AFC area scout	63	4.79999999999999982	joey-hunt	\N
2555186	Marcus	Henry	8	74	294	\N	The 2014 and 2015 first-team All-Mountain West pick at center is not huge, overly athletic, nor physically dominating. But as far as sturdy, reliable linemen go, Henry could be seen as one of the better options in this year?s senior class. Henry also started as a sophomore at right guard, giving him some versatility that will be needed if he is to stick on an NFL roster.	Physical center who looks to finish blocks with authority when he gets the upper hand. Aggressive into first contact looking to jolt defender and set a tone. Uses forceful punch to twisters and blitzers that enter his domain. Plays with decent hip flexion and a wide base. Able to snap hips into contact and can drop his rear to anchor against bull rush. Recovery skills are better than expected. Competitive juices flare after being badly beaten on previous rep.	Limited range as a blocker. Too slow climbing up to angles on second level and cut­off blocks will be challenging. Waist­bender with weight too far forward. Has short arms and small hands prevent him from consistently securing blocks after plus initial contact. Won?t generate much push as an in­line blocker. Limited as blocker in space with a high strikeout rate.	\N	Three-year starter and part of a senior class that won 40 games while at Boise State. Henry lacks the length and size that teams want from draftable center prospects, but he plays with some pop and he works his butt off to stay on his blocks by any means necessary. The will and play demeanor are there to get him into a camp, but other traits may prevent him from hearing his name called in April.	"I actually think he's a better center prospect than Matt Paradis was and that guy is starting in the league." -- NFC South scout	108	5.04999999999999982	marcus-henry	\N
2555187	Max	Tuerk	8	77	298	10.75	Going into the season, it appears this Trojan was on a path similar to the versatile Cameron Erving, the No. 19 overall pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2015 draft. Tuerk has started at nearly every place along the line for the Trojans. He is a bit taller and more slender than most pro pivots, but that may still be his best spot given that he used his mobility and tenacity to earn first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2014. Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in October and will have to prove himself before the draft to maximize his grades.	Exceptional athleticism with elite movement skills in space. Asked to pull for wide sweeps and was frequently downfield leading the charge on screen passes. Natural bender with the ability to play with leverage. Won't over­-commit to a basic secure block in running game which allows him to climb to his target with consistently successful angles. Stalks his prey in space and is able to adjust to moving targets. Plays with patience. Will allow defender to declare a gap before latching on with a well­-timed punch and snapping hips under him. Refuses to quit on a rep. Possesses huge, strong hands that snatch target and allow him to hang against aggressive power players looking to shed. Plays with consistent hand placement. Maintains proper base and can drop a decent anchor against bull­ rushers. Has played at four of the five spots along the offensive line.	Lean, lanky build that looks more like a freshman tackle than a senior center. Has played at a weight well below the norm for an NFL starting center and scouts concerned that keeping mass on his frame will be an issue. When interior players get on his edge, redirecting with the necessary power will be a problem. May need to compensate for a lack of NFL power by adjusting his angles and footwork in order to secure his blocks. Must hit the weights and the training table as much as he can. Opens himself to swim moves by leaning into blocks at times. Would like to see him finish a higher percentage of his second level blocks. Suffered a season­-ending knee injury in October which is likely to alter his pre­draft workouts.	Evan Mathis	Athletic, but undersized center who gives tremendous pound­-for­-pound effort on every rep. Tuerk uses hand strength and plus balance and body control to make up for a lack of power, but his knee injury and below average mass for the position will certainly scare some teams away. Tuerk can handle himself in any scheme but is a fit for primarily zone scheme rushing attacks who don't face many 3­-4 fronts within their division.	\N	50	5.62000000000000011	max-tuerk	\N
2555188	Nick	Kelly	8	73	295	\N	Coming out of Casa Roble High School in Orangevale, Calif., Kelly received no scholarship offers from FBS programs. He went the junior college route, playing in one of his two seasons at American River College in Sacramento. Kelly took over the starting job in second year on campus, earning second team All-Pac-12 notice as a junior. He toughed out multiple injuries that season, starting all 13 games with a torn meniscus in each knee, and on top of that, playing with torn ligaments in his ankle in the team?s bowl game. Kelly was named a team co-captain in his senior season, starting all 13 games in the middle.	Was called on for short and long pulling and was able to get out in front and get to his spots. Thick trunk and and has some sturdiness to his base. When he lands a solid blow, he can can get some movement. Exhibits body control and patience in climbing up to linebackers. Shows potential to battle and anchor against bull ­rushers. Tough guy and considered a great teammate. Played with pain and through meniscus injuries in 2014.	Extremely stiff in his hips, knees and ankles and struggles to get adequate bend. Stiffness creates major issues with functional change of direction to strike and secure moving targets. May not have enough lateral quickness off the snap to consistently secure cross-­face blocks. Waist bender. Leans into blocks causing inconsistency with balance and a lack of extended engagement with the defender. Core strength is very average. Hand work can get sloppy and his lack of arm length is an issue.	\N	Scouts really like Kelly's work ethic and leadership qualities and his willingness to play with pain endears him to coaches. While his toughness and production should land him in a camp, Kelly's lack of functional athleticism and lack of desired physical traits may make it difficult for him to stick on a roster.	\N	45	4.91000000000000014	nick-kelly	\N
2555189	Nick	Martin	6	76	299	9.75	Teams already know what to expect from Nick, as his brother Zack excelled in his first two seasons with Dallas after being selected in the first round in 2014. Nick will bring versatility along with the family toughness to an NFL team. He moves between center and guard without an issue (started at left guard 10 games in 2014, three games at center that year as well as most of 2013 and all of 2015), displaying a strong anchor in pass pro and nimble feet to attack linebackers in the run game. Teams envying the Cowboys' prodigious but athletic front line should consider picking up this Golden Domer.	Loves to play the game as physically as he can. Plays with a mean streak and then some. Finishes a block with authority if he gets the advantage. Showed ability to anchor and play with strengths against power across from him. Usually first into defender after snap. Despite some hip stiffness, moves fairly well when asked to get out in front of screen plays. Keeps head on a swivel at all times. Aware of both gaps when in pass protection and he's uncovered. Plays with wide base in pass pro. Often first to get hands on pass rusher and will get some extension early in the rep. Gets the most out of average length. Team captain and unchallenged leader up front. Has started at guard and center while at Notre Dame so may offer roster flexibility.	Looks labored in his movement. Stiffness in hips stymies ability to sink and anchor. Leads with upper body too often and plays with weight out over his feet. Needs to bring his feet up under him. Had issues redirecting with power against pass rushers who gained early advantage. Gets jostled around and has to work overtime to stay engaged against powerful players. Will struggle to reach and secure move blocks. Can improve with recognition of blitzes.	John Sullivan	Three-year starter who possesses the leadership, intelligence and toughness that general managers and offensive line coaches look for from their centers. A season ending knee injury in 2013 might have taken away some of his natural bend and athleticism, but Martin's play strength and toughness should make him an early starter in the league at either guard or center.	"He was much more athletic before his knee injury. He's had to fight through some physical limitations and I know that he's been frustrated because of that. He struggled in 2014 and I thought he still looked a little beat up this year. If he can get healthy, he'll start in our league." ­-- NFC North scout	43	5.66000000000000014	nick-martin	\N
2555190	Robert	Kugler	8	75	294	\N	It's no surprise that Kugler is the son of a coach (UTEP head coach Sean) given his athletic and academic prowess. He was rated one of the top 10 tight end recruits in the country by Scout.com, but outgrew that position during his redshirt season. The 2015 second team Co-SIDA Academic All-American joined quarterback Drew Brees and defensive end Ryan Kerrigan as Boilermakers receiving Academic All-American honors during their careers. Kugler took over as the starting center halfway through his redshirt freshman season, then started 43 consecutive games in the pivot. The two-time team captain even won team MVP honors as a junior, a rare feat for a center.	Has some initial lateral quickness after the snap when asked to pull. Above-average hand work. Plays with well­-timed punch and does a good job of keeping hands inside framework of defender to mitigate his lack of arm length. Stays busy and looks for work in pass protection when he is uncovered. Understands the position. His father, Sean, is the head coach at UTEP and is a former NFL offensive line coach (Detroit, Buffalo, Pittsburgh). Academic All-­Big Ten every year in college. Plays with intelligence and awareness.	His play strength needs improvement, but not sure he has frame for pure mass. Can struggle to redirect when defender gets on top of his edge. Former tight end who kicked down to center, but doesn?t play with the expected bend and athleticism of a former tight end. Not a consistent enough block­-winner. Fails to win the second half of blocks giving way to the opponent's strength. May not be able to get secure reach blocks on the move. Consistent issues with core strength and body control at point of impact and is often "bounced" at contact.	\N	Lunch pail center with the mindset and determination of an offensive line coach's son, but the functional strength of a former tight end. Kugler's hand work is exactly what coaches will be looking for, but his lack of core strength and inability to win reps against NFL-­level power will be tough for him to overcome.	\N	39	4.94000000000000039	robert-kugler	\N
2555191	Ryan	Kelly	8	76	311	9.625	Kelly had big shoes to fill when he took over for Rimington Trophy winner Barrett Jones in 2013, but he's handled the pressure quite well. A taller, athletic pivot, Kelly was voted honorable mention All-SEC by league media as a junior, and even won the team's Offensive Player of the Week award twice during the year. He followed that up with a consensus first-team all-conference senior year, leading the way for a Heisman Trophy winner in back Derrick Henry and protecting quarterback Jake Coker on the way to the national title game.	Heady player with tons of grit and fight. Shows the toughness to scrap it out against nose guards in an odd front. Fluid mover in space with knee bend and athletic hips. Explodes into down blocks with low pads and decent bend. Looks to latch and lift with hip snap. Rarely penalized over the last two seasons. Diligent off the snap in race to the spot before engaging on reach blocks. Will keep working feet and hips in order to secure and maintain position. Uses good hand placement and hand strength. Battles to stay glued to his block. Block finisher who looks to dole out punishment on double team blocks. Didn't just secure blocks, helped to blow holes open for Crimson Tide rush game. Handles twists well in pass rush and able to maintain pocket depth against bull­rush. Comes with a pedigree of success and mental toughness. Undisputed leader of a physical, well-­oiled machine up front.	Might need to add some beef to his frame. At times, gets overly­ committed to his secure block and fails to see a downhill linebacker dart in behind him. Needs to work on timing of combo blocks. Occasionally drops head into run block and loses sight of target. Won his share of reps at Alabama with toughness over pure talent or power. Much better drive blocker on an angle. Doesn't generate nearly as much push when heads­ up. Could have some issues matching up against more gifted interior players with mass. Shows tendency on zone plays to use wide angles up to linebacker opening up the inside. Plays a little upright on second level climb causing some balance issues at contact.	Bryan Stork	Tenacious leader and three-­year starter for highly successful Alabama program that puts a heavy emphasis on physical and mental toughness. Kelly might not be a combine warrior, but when the pads are strapped, he plays with enough strength and athleticism to thrive in both gap and zone running schemes. While he could use more mass on his frame, Kelly has the necessary skill­ set and football intelligence to step in and challenge for a starting position right away.	\N	88	5.79999999999999982	ryan-kelly	\N
2555192	Siaosi	Aiono	8	74	312	\N	Aiono originally committed to Brigham Young, but changed sides in the Holy War to play for the Utes. After a redshirt season and one year as a reserve, the second-team All-State high school player from California took over as a starter at right tackle in 2013. His build is much better for the pivot, where he?s started each of the last two years. Aiono also showed toughness and work ethic by learning how to snap with his left hand after injuring his right hand during his senior season.	Sturdy, durable build with thickness through bubble and down his calves. Despite lacking knee bend, has some natural anchor drop against bull rush. Strong upper body with decent hand placement. Has played some right tackle. Student of the game who has stepped up and taken on leadership role this season. Makes all the calls up front.	Below average snap­-to­-step quickness and is slow to cut off gap runners with foot movement. Plays upright and straight-legged with undesired pad level. Too often fails to improve positioning or keep defender pinned when engaging on the move allowing his man to work back into the play. Plays with choppy feet rather than leg driver upon contact. Leans into base blocks rather than lifting with hip snap. Leads with helmet ahead of hands too often. Below average athletic ability.	\N	Asked to play in space at Utah, but is likely to be considered just a phone booth center on the pro level. Aiono is smart player with high football character, but a lack of necessary foot quickness and flexibility might make an NFL future a longshot.	\N	80	4.75	siaosi-aiono	\N
2555193	Brandon	Shell	7	77	324	10.75	Yes, Brandon is the great nephew of Pro Football Hall of Famer Art Shell. But it wouldn't matter if he was instead a relative of early television-era star Art Carney ... he simply looks like an NFL tackle with a pro build and long limbs. He may be best at right tackle, a spot which he held down for three years, but he did flash athleticism to pass protect on the left side when he took over the blind side spot as a senior. Either way, if you want a strong run blocker (he will take smaller defenders 10 yards downfield once locked on) who can reach second-level defenders as well, then Shell's your man.	Tall with exceptional length. Uses long arms to help him snare sudden inside pass rush moves and redirect edge speed past the pocket. Doesn?t have great footwork for directional change, but finds way to get it done. Patient and relatively accurate on his climbs up to linebackers off of combination blocks. Uses wide frame to his advantage against linebackers. Tape shows natural power and core strength. Functional base blocker in run game but will stalemate more than he wins. Has been a starting SEC tackle for almost entire time at South Carolina.	Starts with a sound kick­slide, but immediately resorts to a hurried shuffle to try and catch up with edge rusher. Penalties come for rocking pre­-snap for fear of being beaten. Plays with disconnect between hands and feet. Outside foot deadens as he begins to work shoot initial punch in pass pro. More chaser than controlled protector. Too sluggish out of stance to consistently handle stunts inside. Needs better hand placement. Hand strength unimpressive. Doesn?t possess body control of NFL starter.	\N	Shell doesn?t have the feet to play left tackle and doesn?t bend well enough to generate consistent leverage and push as a guard inside. With that said, he has size and length and a four-year starting history in a challenging conference. Add everything up, and Shell looks to be a third day selection as a right tackle only. He may be an eventual starter, but is better­ suited as a backup.	\N	85	5.21999999999999975	brandon-shell	\N
2555194	Cole	Toner	7	77	306	9.75	Toner had to deal with current Indianapolis Colts defender Zack Hodges during every practice as a sophomore and junior, so most opponents on the Ivy League schedule were a piece of cake in comparison. The first-team All-Ivy League pick in both 2014 and 2015 looks like an NFL prospect, and he shows the toughness and footwork to win as a run blocker and pass protector. If the 2015 Associated Press All-American continues to fill out his frame after this season and early in his NFL career, he has a chance to contribute sooner than later.	Shows willingness to give ground in order to improve his angle on cross-­face blocks in zone blocks. Decent timing with climb to second level off combo blocks. Appears to have adequate foot quickness to redirect back inside and is able to mirror rushers. Careful with his punch and won?t give away hands too early. Fires off a heavy, well-­timed punch with some heat behind it. Aggressive approach in pass pro. Looks to take it to the defensive ends rather than sitting back passively and reacting to their rush. Was invited by former NFL GM Phil Savage to play in the Reese's Senior Bowl. Has a basketball background in high school.	Despite basketball background, hip tightness is a concern. Sits up high in two-­point stance and comes out of his stance with elevated pad level. Foot quickness is very average laterally. Marginal bend and foot quickness could present a major concern when asked to cross-­face and secure blocks against NFL athletes. Shuffles wide in his pass sets and doesn?t always maintain proper weight inside opening him up to inside counters in pass rush. Opens and chases at the top of the rush rather than calmly riding rusher around the arc. Too much gallop in his pass sets and not enough quick, choppy steps. Narrow base and lack of hip flexion could indicate an issue with speed-­to­-power rushers. Play strength looks very average.	\N	Projecting Toner as an NFL prospect isn't easy. His tape at Harvard is pretty solid, but the level of competition is nowhere near what he will see as a pro and the more tape you ingest and the more you begin to project, the more his average feet, strength and hip flexion become a concern. Toner's Senior Bowl week will have everything to do with his draft projection. I see him as a right tackle only who might have to battle to earn a roster spot.	\N	231	5	cole-toner	\N
2555195	Fahn	Cooper	7	76	303	\N	Cooper fell below the radar as a high school recruit from Illinois, so he took a scholarship at Bowling Green. He started at left tackle as a redshirt freshman, but wanted to play for a major program so he transferred to the College of DuPage to catch the eyes of recruiters, rather than sitting out a year as a transfer. Ole Miss gladly welcomed him as a starter in 2014 (11 at right tackle, two at left tackle) and he continued to excel with the Rebels as a senior, starting for the suspended Laremy Tunsil the first seven games of the year before moving back to the right side.	Shows toughness in his approach and won?t back down from a physical challenge. Has the length to land an early punch on pass rushers and the big paws to snatch and ride a second level linebacker if he gets into them squarely. Good thickness in his lower half. Head coach Hugh Freeze praises him for leadership on and off the field. Started every game over his two years at Ole Miss and has played both tackle spots.	More of an "in the way" player in space than functional blocker. Base may be too wide in pass sets causing some of his balance issues. A little labored in his pass sets and possesses below average athletic traits. Sluggish in his change of direction. Weight drifts a little behind his feet allowing pass rushers to get strong initial push on him on some reps. Unable to be effective space player.	\N	Cooper is one of the tough guys up front for the Rebels, and he has good size and length for the position, but he will be limited to run blocking in tight quarters and his lack of overall athleticism and body control could make him too leaky in pass protection to ever see the field as a starter.	\N	93	5.04999999999999982	fahn-cooper	\N
2555196	Halapoulivaati	Vaitai	7	78	320	10.625	In high school, Vaitai and his two younger brothers Will and Kevin formed the left side of his team's offensive line. Not surprisingly, Haltom, Texas' running offense was quite left-handed. Halapoulivaati was the top prospect among the three due to his size. He played five games as a back-up in his first season in Fort Worth, and then earned seven starting in year two (first five at right tackle, two at left tackle). Vaitai continued to show versatility, starting at right tackle in 2014 and left tackle in 2015.In his senior year, he garnered second team All-Big 12 honors for the second-ranked scoring offense in the country (46.5 points per game).	Has played both right and left tackle spots at TCU. Shows decent lateral quickness off the snap on zone runs. Adequate athleticism in space as run blocker. Well-­schooled and shows some technical savvy. Looks to land first and with inside hand as pass protector. Keeps head up and chin tucked on most of his pass sets. Able to see twists and games up front and is rarely fooled by them.	Too stiff-­legged and upright after the snap. Can give ground to bull rushers due to high pad level. Very poor hand strength and is inconsistent with arm extension. Lacks strength in hands to latch on and control a rep and allows defenders to break away from him. Very average foot quickness for power step back to challenge inside moves. Doesn?t gain enough ground to the edge in shuffle slides and will be beaten around the corner by athletic, NFL rushers.	\N	Vaitai has been a full-time starter over the last two seasons for a successful TCU squad, but doesn?t have the plus athleticism to play left tackle or the hand strength and core power to start on the right side. Despite decent technique and football intelligence, may be too lacking in physical qualities to make the NFL leap.	\N	63	4.75999999999999979	halapoulivaati-vaitai	\N
2555197	Jason	Spriggs	7	78	301	10.125	Spriggs excelled in his senior season, catching second-team All-Big Ten accolades along with the eyes of scouts. The four-year starter also was named first team All-American by the Football Writers Association of America and third-team honors by the Associated Press. Spriggs had a scary moment on the field in 2014 against Michigan State, as he was taken to the hospital after suffering a helmet-to-helmet blow. But since them he has shown the build (6-foot-7, 307 pounds), anchor in pass protection and willingness to block through the whistle to be the type of prospect NFL offensive line coaches will covet at left tackle.	Athletic frame with long arms. Comes out of his stance with tremendous quickness and has elite lateral movement. Can get to extremely difficult backside cutoff blocks. Knee bender. As a move blocker, lands squarely in the strike zone and rolls hips and feet under him to to wash down defender or secure a down-block. Shows good patience in space with ability to become solid combination blocker in zone scheme. Looks to finish. Able to adjust his assignments on the fly. Is active with his hands in pass pro. Will throw jabs with both hands rather than offering them up for defensive ends to swat. Has tools to substantially slow pass rushers when timing his punch. Durable, four­-year starter.	Play strength needs improvement. Unable to match power as a base blocker and too easy moved off his spot. Struggles to cleanly absorb and eat contact without being jostled. Has crippling issue with over-setting in pass protection. Doesn?t maintain much weight on inner half of his frame and has consistent issues redirecting his weight back inside with suddenness against inside moves. Doesn?t use his length to his advantage often enough. Slows his slide when punching, allowing rushers opportunity to gain advantage around the corner. Needs stronger hands to snatch and control rather than just push. Ability to recover with power or athletic traits are a concern.	Ryan Harris	While Spriggs has been one of the hotter tackles names in some draft circles, the tape shines a bright spotlight on concerns that could derail his future success as a tackle. Spriggs has outstanding athleticism, but his play strength and overall recovery ability are major concerns for a position as important as tackle. In my estimation, a move inside to guard or even center for a zone scheme team is the best fit to accentuate Spriggs? strengths and hide some of his weaknesses.	\N	31	5.54000000000000004	jason-spriggs	\N
2555198	John	Theus	7	78	313	10.125	The five-star recruit struggled at times early in his career for the Bulldogs, though starting at right tackle as a true freshman in the SEC is quite an accomplishment. The light bulb really seemed to go on for Theus in 2014, both in pass protection and as an effective run blocker after he moved to the left side. The Bulldog finished his career by starting every game for the second straight year and being named first-team all-conference. Theus' solid technique and underrated athleticism will make him difficult for teams to ignore early in the draft.	Reliable and consistent. Full time starter for three of his four years at Georgia. Good height with arm length that meets the NFL standards. Plays with pretty good hand quickness and has a well-­timed punch with some pop behind it. Instinctive and reacts quickly to catch and smother twists. Understands importance of early hands and can handle his business when he wins early in the rep. Good balance and set­up in his pass sets. Started at both tackle spots so he may offer some swing tackle potential for NFL teams. Has enough athleticism to help spring runs to the perimeter.	Struggles against plus power and has major issues redirecting when his edge is attacked. Inconsistent sustaining run blocks and will get controlled and rag­-dolled at times if he doesn?t win early with his hands. NFL­-caliber anchor missing against true bull rush. Needs to maintain wider, balanced base when asked to drive block. When beaten inside, has a habit of going dead­-legged and leaning back inside rather than taking quick steps to close off the lane. Has plus hand­-eye coordination, but his feet don?t always seem to be synced to the same schedule. Kick slide quickness to the edge; opens up too early and gives away the edge too early.	David Quessenberry	Consistent starting tackle from the SEC who has battled against upper-­echelon college talent. While Theus has experience at both tackle spots, he may have issues in the NFL because he lacks the foot quickness of a left tackle and the power of a right tackle. He has the technique and talent to be drafted and fight for a swing tackle spot within his first two seasons, but he must add strength and mass.	"I think his skill level is just fine, but he's extremely weak with no edge strength to help widen the pocket. He's not soft, he just isn't strong. That's going to be a big problem for him." -- AFC personnel director	83	5.09999999999999964	john-theus	\N
2555199	Keith	Lumpkin	7	79	317	\N	If a scout drew a picture of the prototypical NFL left tackle, it might look like a portrait of Lumpkin. The former New Jersey high school star started the last 38 games on the blind side for the Scarlet Knights. He used his excellent length to envelop defenders on the edge as a senior, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors from both league coaches and media in 2015.	Outstanding size and length with a wide frame. Accomplished high school basketball player with surprising straight-­line athleticism when getting out in front of tosses and screens. Able to seal off down blocks by effectively utilizing frame. Can engulf and shut down limited pass rushers with no edge quickness or inside counters. Possesses good radar on second level to seek out his target and land a squared blow in run game.	High-­cut, top-heavy tackle who lets his length go to waste too often. Has issues with excessive waist bending not only in pass protection, but also in the running game which produces balance issues. Will lay on pass rushers rather than keeping them at arm's length. Lacks desired hip and knee bend leading to high pad level, poor leverage and a lack of functional anchor against bull rushers. Struggles with change of direction on inside moves and allows his base to get too wide at times in pass pro.	\N	Despite being a 15-point-per-game scorer as a high school basketball player, Lumpkin doesn?t play with the coordinated foot quickness and balance we see in many former basketball players. Offensive line coaches will be intrigued by his long arms and big frame, but his lack of functional flexibility and consistency of engagement needs to be improved in order to make a team.	\N	25	4.90000000000000036	keith-lumpkin	\N
2555200	Kyle	Murphy	7	78	305	9.75	Murphy played like a solid right tackle prospect as a second-team All-Pac-12 pick his junior year, his first full year as a starter. In 2015, however, the brother of former Harvard and Minnesota Vikings tackle Kevin Murphy slid to left tackle and improved greatly in pass protection while maintaining his toughness in the run game. He combined with left guard Joshua Garnett as first-team All-Conference picks on the blind side of quarterback Kevin Hogan, who reaped the benefits of their play.	Has good feel for the position. Very aware in pass protection seeking out blitzes and twists and takes consistent angles up to the linebackers in the running game. Once he gets moving in space, is able to open up his hips and run with a relatively athletic gait. Plays with strong hands and good placement that can snatch and latch if he gets there first. Makes low pad level a priority in run game. Is usually low man and will use good leg drive or snap hips to secure the block. Adequate change direction in space. Patient second level blocker allowing the block to come to him. Outstanding work with teammate Joshua Garnett with combo blocks and double teams. Doesn?t lean in pass protection and can gain decent ground with his kick ­slides.	Feet are just average from a quickness standpoint. While he can be a little slow out of his stance and off to the races when moving laterally. Will get antsy pre-­snap. Tape shows him getting some headstarts that weren?t called by college officials. Troubling anchor issues as pass blocker. Will get stiff legged at impact in protection, raising pad level and losing anchor leverage. Needs to play more flat­-footed when shooting his punch. Speed to power rushers give him problems so may need to make inside hand placement a greater priority.	Ty Sambrailo	Interesting prospect full of juxtapositions. On one hand, he?s an athletic mover in space, but his foot quickness is just average. While he plays with good bend, leg drive and low pad level as a run blocker, he tends to play too tall and lose his anchor against bull­ rushers. Murphy plays with good tackle instincts and shows enough potential to become an eventual starter in the NFL if he can improve his overall strength and tighten up some of his pass protection flaws.	"I don't think you can play him for at least a year until he gets stronger. He's a good run blocker but I don't know if he's strong enough to play on the right side or quick enough to play left." -- AFC general manager	51	5.33000000000000007	kyle-murphy	\N
2555201	Laremy	Tunsil	7	77	310	\N	The 2015 season was difficult for Tunsil. First, he suffered a dislocated ankle and broken leg in Ole Miss' loss to TCU in the 2014 Peach Bowl. Tunsil then was charged with domestic assault against his stepfather in June, reportedly for sticking up for his mother. Those charges were eventually dismissed, but then the NCAA brought another piece of bad news soon after, suspending Tunsil for seven games due to impermissible benefits he received (vehicle loans without payment, free airline ticket and rental car) and failing to be forthcoming with investigators. When he was on the field, though, Tunsil lived up to his billing as the No. 1 high school recruit at offensive tackle. He started nine games at left tackle as a true freshman, earning second-team All-SEC notice from league media and various Freshman All-American honors. Tunsil missed two games with a partially torn bicep in 2014, but started the rest, garnering first-team All-SEC nod from the Associated Press (second team from coaches) and All-American recognition from multiple media outlets. He didn?t make many post-season all-conference lists in his shortened junior season (starting six games at left tackle), but finished his career in a way most offensive linemen can only dream of -- running in a two-yard touchdown on a throw-back pass behind the line of scrimmage in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State.	Came into Ole Miss as five-­star prospect and lived up to every bit of the hype. Has the elite foot quickness of a high­-end NFL tackle and his base remains balanced and uncompromised throughout his pass reps. Excellent bend and overall flexibility in his ankles, knees and hips and maintains good pad level throughout his pass sets. Plays with textbook hand usage. Possesses a boxer's jab in his left hand with measured accuracy, timing and force. Uses length to control the rep, but is willing to slide and mirror without even punching if defender continues to linger outside his reach. "Basketball defender" who understands importance of footwork and positioning in pass protection. Heady tackle with plus instincts and reads keys for hints of upcoming blitzes and twists. Heat­-seeking missile in open field as screen blocker. Very good body control and balance. Makes climb to second level with good timing and gathers himself to make accurate strikes on linebackers. Got into LSU's linebackers and gave them the absolute blues in running game.	Frame could use more mass. After initial punch in pass protection, will lose patience and reach at times while looking for second contact. Failed to start and play in every game in any of his three seasons. When bull rushers get to an edge, they can generate some push to the pocket. More of a finesse run blocker than drive blocker. Great feet don't come with powerful leg drive. Missed bowl game in 2013 due to knee injury, two games in 2014 due to partially torn bicep and seven games in 2015 due to receiving impermissible benefits.	Tyron Smith	From a talent and technique standpoint, Tunsil is easily cleanest offensive lineman in the 2016 draft and might be the cleanest prospect period. Tunsil showed signs of rust against Texas A&amp;M in his first game back from a seven-game suspension, and he still kept Myles Garrett in check. Tunsil lacks pure power, but has the body control to be a quality run blocker in space and on levels. Ultimately, his feet, technique and instincts could make him an all-p­ro and one of the top pass protectors in the NFL.	\N	93	7.71999999999999975	laremy-tunsil	\N
2555202	Le'Raven	Clark	7	77	316	11.875	Clark started 51 straight games for the Red Raiders, spending his final three years at left tackle and his freshman season at right guard. All three years at left tackle, he earned All-Big 12 honors, and as a senior he was named a second-team All-American for his efforts. It's unclear where Clark's best position will be at the next level; he flashes the lateral agility and recovery speed to play on the edge against college pass rushers, so he should get a shot at left tackle. It?s possible, though, that Clark might be best inside where he can lock on and create creases for the running game. His durability, pro-ready body (6-6, 313), and next-level tenacity make him a likely NFL starter wherever he lines up.	Possesses good thickness through his rear and thighs helping him drop and anchor. Plays with outstanding foot quickness in his pass sets. Able to mirror head­-faking pass rushers like a cornerback with ability to shift weight and change directions seamlessly. Uses choppy, controlled slides in pass sets instead of long, protracted kick-­slides. Able to shut down darting inside moves with relative ease. Blessed with exceptionally long arms. Uses length and excellent timing to get hands on edge rushers quickly disrupting their game­plan. Has athleticism to effectively recover and fight back when he gets beaten. When he gets hands on defender and locks out, it is over. Has impressive sink steps inside to wall of B­-gap against twists and the backside in running game. Does adequate job of sustaining blocks. Plus lateral quickness off the snap. Can reach and seal the edge in run game. Accelerates into angle blocks, runs his feet and washes defender down. As base blocker, has ability to strike, turn and pin defensive ends on off­-tackle runs his way. Instinctive and proactive against twists.	Allows weight to creep forward past his feet and will get caught leaning,­ especially when trying to run rushers around the arc. Plays with average body control. Struggled to match inside/out rush moves of LSU?s Arden Key in his bowl game. Hands can be a little frenetic and end up outside defender?s frame. Will benefit from a stronger inside hand in his punch. Needs to improve hand placement. Slightly deficient in core power. Has quick feet but average footwork, especially after contact. Posture in protection needs work. Rarely a flat­-backed, flat­-footed puncher. Leans and makes contact while on balls of his feet or with feet in transition and will give some ground. Footwork and hands not always synced. Relies too heavily on length over feet. Pad level rises at contact robbing him of optimal leverage. Not a natural bender in space and struggles to redirect his body and strike moving targets.	Bobby Massie	Clark is an ascending left tackle prospect with the elite foot quickness and length that NFL teams simply don?t pass up for very long. Clark could still use more muscle on his frame and will need to be much more consistent with his technique rather than just relying on his length if he is to reach his full potential in the pros. Left tackles with his potential in pass protection carry first round value and Clark has a Pro Bowl upside with the floor of an average NFL starter.	"He's going to end up being big time in our league. He's got elite foot quickness, he's long and he's smart. He'll keep getting better once he gets to a pro offense and away from that stuff Texas Tech does and he'll become one of the top five tackles in our league." -- NFC personnel director	21	6.04999999999999982	leraven-clark	\N
2555220	Derek	Watt	3	74	236	\N	Watt isn't an athletic freak like his older brother and 2014 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, J.J. Watt, but he'll be a tough cut from an NFL roster. While not a thumping fullback/H-back, he has the athleticism to find targets and create creases for excellent backs such as 2015 first-round pick Melvin Gordon. Watt is a solid receiver (15 catches for 139 yards this season) and can contribute on special teams as well, showing off the tackling skills he possessed as a second-team USA Today All-American high school linebacker. He played the second half of the 2014 season while recovering from a broken foot in the opener, but came back to stay healthy as a senior.	Utility man deployed all over the field. Used as lead-blocking fullback in traditional rushing attack. Blocked from "I," off­set and tight end spots. Great radar to fit up on linebackers. Plays with desired toughness and dirty work mentality for the position. Shows no hesitation into iso blocks or when asked to take on defensive linemen. Solid in pass protection. Runs a quality route and had no drops this season. Runs through first contact after the catch. Work ethic and football IQ run in the family. Can offer immediate special teams work.	Needs to add more beef to match­up with NFL size. Doesn?t have NFL­ juice as a lead blocker. Will need to improve angles and leverage as a lead blocker to offset lack of power. Half­strider who doesn?t have the acceleration or stride to create much separation out of his breaks as a pass catcher. Mostly a body catcher.	Kyle Juszczyk	Watt?s versatility will be appealing to offenses looking for hybrid types who help to disguise their offensive intentions. While he?s not a hammer­head lead blocker who can blow holes open, he can handle his blocking assignments. Watt is an effective play-­action fullback who is a jack-­of­-all­-trades player, but master of none. Watt will likely be a third day selection by a team looking for a solid move­ fullback.	\N	40	5.09999999999999964	derek-watt	\N
2555203	Parker	Ehinger	6	78	310	9.875	Junior quarterback Gunner Kiel and his talented receivers made the headlines throughout the 2015 season, but Ehinger (pronounced EIN-ger) was a major reason for the team's success. He was a Freshman All-American in 2012, mostly starting at right tackle using his height and length. Ehinger moved to right guard for the team's bowl game that year and stayed there for two years, moving defenders in the run game and protecting the quarterback. He moved to left tackle for his senior year, using his strength and wide base effectively in pass protection ?- earning his second straight first-team All-American Athletic Conference nod.	Sets up in pass pro with balanced base and good posture. Keeps chin tucked and isn?t caught leaning very often. Wall off run blocker. Plays with good instincts and sees twists and blitzes as they develop. Four-year letterman along offensive line that was one of the better pass protection units during his time there.	Core strength is below desired level and he can be jarred by a hard punch. Unable to drive his one­-on-one block off the spot and and is poor at sustaining his run blocks. Plays with dead legs in space and change of direction is not functional. Opens up early against edge rush and gives away inside rush lane to counter moves. Marginal anchor. Feet and punch aren?t properly timed up.	\N	Ehringer has the size to be an NFL tackle, but doesn?t have enough athletic ability to be a successful tackle in pass protection. While some may project Ehringer inside due to his lack of quickness, a lack of functional strength at the point of attack could doom that move as well.	\N	56	4.90000000000000036	parker-ehinger	\N
2555204	Ronnie	Stanley	7	78	312	10.625	Stanley had a chance to leave for the National Football League after his third year in South Bend, but decided to return after watching Ohio State win the national championship in January of 2015. He wanted to be part of a national championship contender. Although that didn?t quite happen (Notre Dame lost games to conference champions Clemson and Stanford, each by two points before losing to Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl), Stanley didn't hurt his draft stock with a 2015 second-team All-American season at left tackle. NFL scouts had hoped he would come out the year before, as he looked like a future pro while starting all 13 games at left tackle as the Irish's Offensive Lineman of the Year in 2014. Stanley started every game at the right tackle as a redshirt freshman (he played two early season games as a reserve in 2012), showing great promise. A durable, intelligent player with experience at both tackle spots, Stanley will be a coveted prospect.	Races out of the starting blocks and into pass sets as well as anyone in the country. Has long arms and knows how to use them. Plays with quick hands and a well-­timed punch. Never panics when he loses hand placement, simply re­sets them. Specializes in quick­sets getting his hands into the pass rusher first helping him to control the flow of the snap. Well­-coached with great hand placement. Wins with activity over power. Is not often beaten around the edge by speed. Hard worker who plays through the whistle. Flexible and athletic with plus change of direction ability against counter moves. Has quickness off the snap to get to challenging backside blocks on linebackers. Able to pull into space and hit moving targets to spring the big run. Fell off of too many blocks in 2014, but did much better job of bringing his feet under him this year to help him sustain his blocks. In run game, able to gain late victories when it looks like stalemate is coming. Durable and dependable.	In need of more functional, core power. Has to hang on for a ride when engaging against a physical defender who plays with leverage. Will need to win with feet and technique. Doesn?t have upper body strength to maul when his rep gets off track. Has athleticism to recover when he?s beaten but is just average at redirecting his man off-­course once defender gets the advantage. Is more quick that explosive. Gives ground to bull rushers when his feet aren?t set at punch. Balance is average.	Lane Johnson	Three-year starter with the outstanding foot quickness and pass protection talent expected from an early round left tackle prospect. Stanley showed great maturity in acknowledging his weaknesses and returning to school to work on them and improve his game. While Stanley?s core power is still a concern, he showed improved strength and run blocking prowess this year and should be ready to come in and start right away for a team looking to protect a high-­end quarterback.	\N	43	6.70000000000000018	ronnie-stanley	\N
2555205	Stephane	Nembot	7	78	322	10.75	Stephane Nembot (steff-on name-bot) was born in Cameroon, speaks three languages (English, French, and Spanish) and well as 11 African dialects. He began playing football in his junior year of high school, starring as a defensive end. But as he grew into his massive frame during his redshirt freshman season at Colorado, coaches moved him over to right tackle -- during the middle of a game. He started the next week, and the following 36, at that right tackle spot before moving to the left side for the last month of the 2015 season. Nembot has agility and length to spare, and despite his still-leggy frame has added 40 pounds during his career at CU.	Long­-levered tackle prospect with gigantic hands. Has experience at both left and right tackle spots. Has shown improvement in each of his year's at the position. Sack total dropped from six (2013) to 4.5 (2014) to three (2015). Full time starter for the better part of four years. Aggressive with his punch and has some snap at the end of it to impact pass rusher's course. Has the athleticism and quickness to become a capable run blocker in space. Has high success rate in collapsing his man in down­blocks. Much more disciplined in 2015 cutting holding down from five to one and false starts from four to one.	Lean frame that could use longer trips to the training table. Moved from defensive end to offensive tackle as a redshirt freshman so he's still a work in progress. Footwork gets sloppy in run game and gets caught thinking rather than reacting. Ends up on ground entirely too much due to poor body control. Lacks power in lower half to win in the neutral zone as base blocker. Plays on skates in his pass sets. Over­shifts his weight outside and then is unable to recover back inside when pass rushers come underneath him. Not enough bend or strength to drop anchor and battle back against a bull rush. Below average instincts.	\N	Nembot is a project who would get a quarterback killed if he had to step into a starter?s role next season. However, evaluators will understand this and will likely give him time to continue growing into his frame and working on his technique. Nembot's play strength and balance is a substantial concern and might always be an issue for him, but he?s got size and length and teams take chances on those traits at tackle.	\N	11	5.08999999999999986	stephane-nembot	\N
2555206	Taylor	Decker	7	79	310	\N	Ohio State's undisputed leader on the offensive line decided to come back for another year in Columbus instead of applying for entry into the 2015 draft, where he might have been a mid-to-late first-round pick. Decker not only got a chance to win back-to-back national titles during his senior year, but also an opportunity to prove he has the natural bend and elite athleticism (to go along with his obvious length, strength, and toughness) to be a top-five selection. The 2015 Big Ten Offensive Lineman of the Year played strong as the Buckeyes came up just short of reaching the College Football Playoff.	Good height and overall frame. Endowed with very good core strength and an ability to match power at the point of attack. Tough guy who scouts believe has the locker room presence and field demeanor to be an instant leader along an offensive line. Can be a brute in double teams and on down­blocks. Fires into his target and drives his feet through contact, blowing open creases into lanes. Doesn?t give lip service to second level blocks and looks to strike a memorable lick on linebackers and safeties. At his best in vertical pass sets where he is smooth and natural. Gains good ground with his first two kick slides. Flat­-backed pass sets with ready hands, a hearty punch and good hand placement. Has hand strength to snatch and control a centered block. Three-­year starter with a winner?s pedigree. Played basketball in high school which helped with his body control.	Has a tendency to pop straight up and play with high pads when moving laterally or in space. Shows surprisingly limited knee bend for being a former basketball player. Struggles to redirect his weight quickly and changing directions to hit moving targets is a chore. Stiff­ strider in space. Shows tendency to over­set when attempting to set out on speed rushers. Upright style will cause problems for him against edge trimming pass rushers who can get under him. Average reactive athleticism limits effectiveness against counter moves back inside. Mirrors well pre­contact, but ability to mirror diminishes once first contact has been made. Short arms for his height. Too reliant on hand strength and upper body power over footwork and balance. Has issues consistently redirecting defenders who get to his edge.	Sebastian Vollmer	His intangibles will likely help make up for some of his physical deficiencies, but he likely lacks the arm length and consistency against edge rushers to play on the left side as a pro. Decker has the run-blocking prowess and mindset to be a long-time starter at right tackle, but may always be a little leakier in pass protection than offensive line coaches and quarterbacks might like.	"I hope you kill this guy because I would love for him to fall to us. He's strong and tough.

He and his doctors thought an offseason of rehabbing would heal it; unfortunately, his ACL didn't agree. But after sitting out the 2014 season, Johnstone proved to be back at full strength in his senior campaign, starting every game and earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors. Using his time off last year to add bulk might pay off in the end, as now he has strength to fend off bull rushers as well as the athleticism to handle good pass rushers on the edge.	Has proven that he could add more mass and strength through additional weight work during his rehab work. Before his last knee injury, he showed exceptional fluidness and athleticism in setting out to defensive ends and climbing to second level. Scouts hope that athleticism will return with time. Plays hard to the whistle. Has ability to finish with some authority if he gets the clear upper hand. Has proper weight distribution in his kick slides. Has enough hand strength to ride the bull and finish a turbulent rep with continued engagement. Patient with hands and won?t give them away too early to pass rushers.	Unfortunate injuries appear to have robbed him of some of his agility and athleticism. Left Oregon?s 2013 bowl game with torn ACL and then tore the same ACL again in first practice of 2014 forcing him to miss entire season. Sluggish to unglue from first block and work to his second block during combo blocks. Plays with narrow base limiting his lower body strength. More of a lean-and-push than bend-and-lift blocker. Unable to absorb contact on the move and maintain his balance. Subpar body control. Post-­injury ability to mirror is questionable.	Tyler Polumbus	In watching 2013 tape of Johnstone, he was much more athletic than the player I studied from 2015 after his knee injuries. While his medicals will play a huge part in whether or not he is drafted, play strength has always been a problem. Without functional flexibility and explosiveness, a career in the NFL will be difficult.	\N	48	4.84999999999999964	tyler-johnstone	\N
2555208	Willie	Beavers	7	76	324	9.5	At the end of Beavers' redshirt freshman year, Broncos coaches did something they wouldn't regret: start him at left tackle. He's been a stalwart on the blind side ever since (40 straight games), playing with a strong base, good feet, and excellent tenacity as a pass protector and run blocker. The 2015 first-team All-MAC (second team in 2014) pick?s size is only average, at best, for a tackle, but he'll get his shot.	Loose, fluid athlete for the position with very good foot quickness and agility. Quick out of his stance and is eager to get into his target first. first. Easy, natural mover in space and has all the traits to be effective as a zone scheme blocker. Has the quickness to get to difficult second level blocks. Uses staccato choppiness in his pass sets allowing him to make quick, power step back inside against slants, twists and counter moves. Has bubble butt with broad hips. When locking out as a base blocker, can generate impressive torque and turn from his hips and knock his man off-balance. Extremely competitive and active on each snap. Has quick hands and flashes some strength in them to snatch and maintain contact. Tends to remain engaged with his block for as long as possible. Won't quit when he?s beaten early in the snap. Has reactive athleticism to give himself an opportunity to battle back into a play. Processes twists and blitzes quickly and reacts accordingly. Played Michigan State and Ohio State in September and passed those tests.	Overly eager and impatient at times. Excessive movement post­-snap. Body control would benefit from "quieter" approach with hands. Must learn to call himself and play with greater patience. Desire to get hands on defender quickly opens him up to lunging and missing when pass rushers don?t immediately burst upfield and into contact. Needs to play with more consistent pad level. Appears to have average core strength and redirect power when opponent gets to his edge. Will play with a wide, grabby outside hand in pass protection. Needs to improve hand placement and punch to make better use of his 34-inch arms. Against speed on the edge, will over-set from time to time rather than trusting his own foot quickness. Could use a little wider base in pass pro. When blocking on an angle, uses inconsistent path allowing linebackers and defensive tackles to leak inside.	Derek Newton	Beavers is very athletic with the feet to play left tackle, but has the talent and traits to play all over the offensive line with more technique work. While he clearly has some power and twitch in his hips, he could use a year in an NFL weight room to strengthen his core and upper body. Beavers is an eventual NFL starter who is likely to be targeted by teams who covet tackles who can excel in space.	\N	107	5.48000000000000043	willie-beavers	\N
2555209	Chris	Moore	4	73	206	9.375	The Bearcats have a slew of receivers that helped the team finish sixth in the country in passing yardage in 2015, but despite the rotation, Moore has been the definition of a big-play receiver during his career at Cincinnati. Though he only had four catches as a redshirt freshman, they covered 113 yards (28.3 average) and he scored twice. Moore caught a career-high 45 passes in 2013 for 645 yards and nine scores, and then covered more yardage (673) and nearly as many touchdowns (eight) on only 30 receptions as a junior. Quarterback Gunner Kiel and Moore helped the Bearcats to that lofty ranking in 2015, with the receiver finishing second on the team with 870 yards and leading the squad with seven touchdowns on just 40 catches. His 21.8 yard per-catch average finished fourth in the FBS.	Has good size and long arms for his position. Long­-strider with build­up speed used to get on top of cornerbacks who don't show him proper vertical respect. Saw 33 percent of his catches this season go for 25-plus yards and averaged almost 22 yards per catch over last two seasons. Frame to break tackles in open field. Not afraid to roam the middle of the field. Adequate ball tracking skills. Finds ball early, adjusts routes as needed and flashes some ability to make the tough, downfield catch.	Limited receiver. Benefited from high percentage of free-release snaps against Bearcats' opponents. Straight­-liner with hip stiffness limiting sink into breaks and sudden change of direction. Shows some balance issues against press coverage. When crowded off snap, slow to adjust and get into routes. Upright into breaks and routes can be dull and unfocused. Juking defenders after catch isn't his forte. Allows throws into his frame and defaults to body­ catching. Had nine drops over last two seasons.	\N	His size and speed may draw some interest from teams, but he's a one-­trick, vertical receiver who doesn't possess the elite speed that can compensate for his average hands and below average routes. Moore is a developmental prospect who will need time to work on his deficiencies but might be limited by his lack of return game experience on the college level.	\N	56	5.20000000000000018	chris-moore	\N
2555210	D'haquille	Williams	4	74	229	9.25	Halfway through the 2014 season, it looked as though Williams was going to be the second former junior college receiver climbing up draft boards, along with West Virginia's Kevin White. However, a sprained MCL suffered late in the year and suspension for breaking team rules pushed Williams to return to school for the 2015 season. Then Williams reportedly assaulted multiple people while intoxicated in an Auburn club, and was dismissed from the team forthwith (though no one filed charges against Williams, who wasn't named in the police report.) Before the incident, Williams? production hadn't been great (12 catches, 147 yards, one score in five games.) Now NFL teams will have to decide whether he has the maturity, or the game, to be a valued prospect.	Big frame and usually plays to his size. Will post up cornerbacks down the field and uses his body to shield throws from defenders. Natural pass catcher with soft hands. Saw 82 percent of his catches go for first downs in 2014. At his best in longer developing, intermediate routes. Does solid job of setting up routes with leverage points and head ­fakes. Makes downfield catches with well­-timed hands to consistently pluck throws at the high­ point and will lay out to make the tough catch. Can grind out an extra couple of yards after the catch in order to get the first down. Has the size to help run game as a blocker if his care factor is right.	Consistent discipline issues at Auburn. Suspended for Outback Bowl after 2014 season, missed practices for "personal reasons" this August and was kicked off of the team in October admitting he "made mistake after mistake" which lead to his dismissal. Stiff hips and below average athlete. Restricted, semi­-strider off snap and slow into routes. Won?t slip many tackles in the open field after the catch. Despite his size, blocking not a priority for him. Small hands for his size. Can't shake free underneath and will have to live off of contested catches. Very little acceleration for separation out of breaks. Could be forced into slot role only. Looked like he was going through the motions in 2015 before his dismissal. Scouts don?t trust his personal or football character at all.	Geremy Davis	While he has good overall size, Williams appears to lack the athleticism and big play potential that might cause a team or two to overlook all of his off­-field issues at Auburn. With no Senior Bowl invite and a reputation as a malcontent, Williams is unlikely to be taken before the third day of the draft and might go completely undrafted unless he blows teams away at his workout sessions.	"I can tell you that he burned all of his bridges over there (Auburn). He's a selfish, me­-first guy and I don't think he's trustworthy in the locker room at all. He didn't compete at all this year. I wouldn't draft him in any round." -- NFC Director of Personnel	90	5.36000000000000032	dhaquille-williams	\N
2555211	Geronimo	Allison	4	75	196	9.5	Allison?s journey to Illinois was a bit circuitous. He didn?t play high school football as a sophomore or junior, so he fell a bit below the recruiting radar. Allison received plenty of major college football love after two years at Iowa Western Community College, as he helped the Reivers win a national title in 2012 and rank second in the nation in 2013 (69-872, eight touchdowns). He contributed immediately as a junior (41-598, five scores) and then earned honorable mention All-Big Ten (65-882, three touchdowns) by leading the Illini in receiving this fall. Allison is a lean strider who stretches defenses vertically and is able to high-point passes, making him a potential red zone weapon.	Can steer clear of press coverage with foot quickness and head fakes off the snap. High point pass catcher who gets full extension when trying to pluck the high throws. Able to stick the landing when making a touch catch near the boundary. Angular receiver who will fight through a tackler after the catch. As a blocker, squares up his target and gives above average effort as a blocker on the edge. Grinds on film. Voted team captain multiple weeks in 2015 and takes his role of team leader seriously.	Below average deep threat. Rare to see him run a go route past a cornerback and make himself an open vertical target. Lack of deep speed allows cornerbacks to sit on underneath routes. Ohio State cornerbacks ran his routes all day long. Focus drops an issue this year. Had drop rate of just over 11 percent this year. Play speed into routes needs to improve. Hip stiffness prevents him from sinking hips into breaks. Below average acceleration out of breaks. Too often crowds himself against the boundary.	\N	Long and lanky, Allison didn?t play football his junior or senior year and played two years of junior college ball before finishing his final two seasons at Illinois. While Allison is still a work and progress and did show growth during his senior season, his inability to consistently create separation will likely trump his height and willingness to help out in the running game. The tape doesn?t show enough speed, but if he runs well during the postseason, he will get some attention.	\N	30	4.86000000000000032	geronimo-allison	\N
2555221	Derrick	Henry	2	75	247	8.75	It's tough to accomplish more as a high school or college athlete than Henry did over the past five years. He won the 2012 Maxwell Club National High School Player of the Year award after setting a national record for career rushing yards (12,124, including 4,261 in his senior season) and scored 153 touchdowns. Then, despite breaking his leg in spring practices after graduating early from Yulee High (Florida), Henry averaged more than 10 yards per carry as a true freshman for the Tide (35-382, 3 TDs) and scored on a 61-yard reception -- his only one of the season. Even though the 6-3, 242-pound back started just two games as a sophomore, Henry consistently shared carries with T.J. Yeldon, covering 990 yards on just 172 totes (5.8 per) and scoring 11 times. He topped off his collegiate career by winning the 2015 Heisman Trophy, along with the Doak Walker, Maxwell, Walter Camp Player of the Year awards. The unanimous first-team All-American led the nation with 2,219 rushing yards and 28 rushing touchdowns last fall, more or less winning the Heisman by racking up 213 yards and three touchdowns against LSU in a showdown with fellow trophy hopeful Leonard Fournette (who had 31 yards for the game). His true "Heisman moment" came after he already owned the hardware, as he came up huge in the national championship game win over Clemson, carrying the pail 36 times for 167 yards and three scores.	One of the biggest running backs you will ever see. Can be a violent runner without even trying. Pummels tacklers with forward lean and dynamite behind his pads. Gives run-­support cornerbacks bad dreams. Rare top­-end speed for a runner his size. Long strides from second to third level cut into reaction time for safeties and often leave them a step short and grasping for air. Effective in zone, gap and power schemes. Rarely fatigues and wears down defenses as game goes on. Had 29.6 percent of his explosive carries come in the fourth quarter. Makes consistent, initial reads as a zone runner. Against Mississippi State, took outside zone run and cut it all the way back across formation out­racing defense for 65-yard touchdown. Led nation in missed tackles forced with 60. Uses subtle change of direction on the second level while keeping runs north/south. Used as a possession bully in short yardage spots and when Alabama wanted to impose their will.	With almost 400 touches this year, scouts are concerned about his workload. Averaged almost 32 carries against SEC competition including 90 carries over his final two regular season games. Tall, long-strider who takes time to build up his speed. Average foot quickness can lead to tackles for losses if he gets too cute in the backfield. Needs to improve his second read as a zone runner. Ineffective in passing game with below average hands. Narrow based running style allows defenders to trip him up. More run­-finisher than tackle breaker with just seven broken tackles to Leonard Fournette's 22. Sluggish cut­back ability once he's outside the tackle box.	Brandon Jacobs	Bell-cow running back with an ability to strap on feedbag and eat for four quarters. Henry's long legs and angular running style is a much better fit for downhill running teams who value lead backs and physicality. Henry needs early running room as he's not a creator in the backfield, but once he gets up a full head of steam, he is a nightmare with his ability to punish on the second and third level or take it to the house. Henry should come in and provide immediate production as a starter.	\N	88	6.15000000000000036	derrick-henry	\N
2555212	Hunter	Sharp	4	71	198	9.375	A cousin of Kansas City Chiefs star linebacker Derrick Johnson, it's no surprise that Sharp shows Sunday-type athleticism. After excelling at the junior college level for two years, the California native put on a show for the Aggies the past two years. Sharp garnered honorable mention All-Mountain West honors in 2014, using strong hands and excellent quickness to snatch 66 balls out of the air for 939 yards and seven scores, four of which were longer than 70 yards (most in the nation). General managers will ask about the two-game suspension he served to start the 2015 season, though he managed to bounce back for a second-team All-Mountain West campaign (71-839, nine touchdowns).	Can ruin a cornerback?s entire day with his speed. Explodes off the line of scrimmage with forward lean and is able to open to full stride almost immediately. Combines swivel hips along with bravado and speed to make his mark after the catch. Weaves through traffic in his routes and after catch seamlessly. Can make defenders miss, but isn?t afraid to lean in and finish his run aggressively. Used from slot, outside and out of backfield. Big play potential vertically or underneath after the catch. Uses stutter-­and­-go to get cornerbacks tilting early in his release. Has the play strength and instant burst that should allow him to defeat press coverage as a pro. Runs patient, controlled routes and can maximize separation. Can return punts and kicks. Ran a variety of routes over last two seasons. Run blocking needs refining but he?s more than willing to do his share.	Has a bad habit of waiting on throws. Allows throws to get on top of him rather than getting arm extension and attacking the throw early. Suspended for two full games to start the season for a violation of team rules. Length of suspension could raise red flags for scouts. Could stand to eliminate some wasted motion in his routes. Built more like a running back than a receiver. Lacks the height and arm length teams like from outside receivers who are called on to win 50/50 throws downfield. Wasn?t physically challenged by quality press coverage very often in college.	Steve Smith	Sharp was used as a catch-­and-­run target in 2014, but this season, Utah State allowed him to take the top off of his defenses with his blazing speed. Sharp has the speed and overall ability to play outside but he could also be used in the slot by teams looking to mismatch him on slower or less physical cornerbacks. His two­-game suspension is a concern for NFL scouts and they will dig deeper into his background, but as a football player, he has the talent to become a very productive starter.	"I like him quite a bit as a player. He didn't get that two-game suspension for nothing so there is that. Hard to imagine anyone watching the tape of him not being immediately impressed. I wish he were a little bit taller but I see him as a move receiver who can switch between outside and the slot depending on the matchups from game to game." -- NFC area scout	73	5.37000000000000011	hunter-sharp	\N
2555213	Jay	Lee	4	73	214	9.625	A size-speed prospect, Lee's ability to stretch the field has worked perfectly in Art Briles' prolific Baylor offense. He stepped up his game as a junior, catching 41 passes for 633 yards and six touchdowns and even throwing a 53-yard touchdown pass to Corey Coleman in the Cotton Bowl against Michigan State. Lee became an even bigger part of the Bears? nation-leading offense in 2015, averaging nearly 20 yards per catch using his striding speed and scoring eight touchdowns. Lee was a nice foil to Coleman this fall, a role he'll likely play at the next level.	Has height/weight/speed combination that has NFL evaluators intrigued. Rare arm length (33 inches) for the position and uses it to his advantage. Has ability to reach throws that may fall just out of reach with some receivers and was able to adjust and snare an occasional low throw. Silky smooth in his movements with good footwork into and out of his breaks. Easy strider off the line of scrimmage and is able to chomp up cornerback cushion before they know what's happening. Hits second gear and presents an open vertical target. Has ability to gain yards in space after the catch and is physical in his finish. Relied upon to be blocker in screen game and has ability to control his block on perimeter.	Ran limited number of routes in Baylor offense that looks to isolate defensive backs in space. Production might be skewed by scheme. Routes tend to be flat and rounded. Needs to prove he can win with separation underneath and with his in and out breaking routes. Inconsistent hands due to technique. Uses unorthodox hand placement and catches ball near his body leading to high drop rate. Wasn't forced to deal with press coverage much in wide-­open Big 12. Scouts question his confidence and whether he has swagger needed to reach his potential.	\N	Angular, fifth-­year senior working with the height/­weight/­speed triangle that evaluators look for. Lee?s senior tape flashed NFL potential as an outside receiver and he has the vertical traits to match. His ability as a run blocker may push him up a few boards, but whispers about his lack of confidence combined with his penchant for dropping throws will have evaluators watching him closely at the Senior Bowl.	\N	10	5.34999999999999964	jay-lee	\N
2555214	Laquon	Treadwell	4	74	221	9.5	Another one of Ole Miss' great recruiting pickups over the past few years, Treadwell was a five-star recruit, consensus All-American, and overall No. 1 receiver prospect in the country. Not surprisingly, he parlayed his talent to selection as the top freshman in the SEC in 2013 (72-608, five scores). Things were going swimmingly for Treadwell as a sophomore until he suffered a broken fibula against Auburn in the last month of the season; he finished with 48 catches for 632 yards and five touchdowns in nine games. Despite the late-season injury, he worked hard (losing 25 pounds without any strength) to play in the 2015 season opener and helped the Rebels beat Alabama in mid-September (5-80, TD). Treadwell only got better as he gained confidence in his surgically-repaired leg, finishing the year with 82 catches, 1,153 yards, and 11 scores as a Biletnikoff Award finalist, All-American (second team Walter Camp, third team AP), and first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches. The icing on the cake for Treadwell was his performance in his final game for Ole Miss, catching three touchdowns against Oklahoma State in the Rebels' Sugar Bowl victory.	Good height and overall length. Smart receiver with a competitive edge when the ball is in the air. Catch- winner. Has a natural feel for the nuances of the position. Has feel for defender and is careful to work back to throws while shielding cornerbacks from the ball. Hands catcher with adequate body control who can climb the ladder and high point catches over defenders. Truly shines with ball-­tracking skills and rarely gives away location of the ball with early movements when racing downfield against cornerbacks. Has subtle shiftiness in his routes thanks to his clean footwork. Can stagger and stutter feet while still working through his routes. Zone eater who has great understanding of positioning in space and giving his quarterback cleanest throw possible. Uses quality stiff­arm after the catch for additional ?RAC? yards. Willing to block, but has size and temperament to become much better at it.	Doesn?t have the cushion-­eating, vertical speed to scare cornerbacks. Cornerbacks will crowd his underneath routes from off­-man coverage. Benefitted with several easy catches in space against zone coverage. Struggled to free himself from press coverage against LSU?s Tre?Davious White and may have separation issues in pros against quick cornerbacks. Takes time to gear down into breaks once he gets speed up. Could stand to be more physical in his release against press. Had more focus drops in 2015 than over previous two seasons. Suffered season-­ending injury in November of 2014 with broken fibula and dislocated ankle.	DeAndre Hopkins	Like DeAndre Hopkins, both players should be defined by their talent, ball skills and consistency of production over pure speed numbers. Treadwell is at his best when he has a clean, two-­way go off the line of scrimmage and he could be a challenging size matchup from the slot. While Ole Miss used him underneath quite a bit, he runs quality downfield routes and has the ball skills needed to become a more vertical receiver than underneath, possession guy.	"He's going to get beat up because he's slow but I like everything else he does. You would think scouts would learn about overestimating speed and underestimating tape. He'll go in the first but not sure how high." -- AFC Southeastern scout	93	6.25	laquon-treadwell	\N
2555215	Leonte	Carroo	4	72	211	9.625	Despite the fact he was losing his quarterback of eight years in Gary Nova (they played together at Don Bosco Prep, as well) for his senior year, Carroo decided to stay in college for one more year. The honorable mention All-Big Ten pick in 2014 (1,068 receiving yards, 19.7 yards per catch, 10 touchdowns) didn?t have quite as much success as a senior (39-809, 10 touchdowns), mostly because a high-ankle sprain and suspension for an assault arrest (the charges for which were dropped by the female victim) kept Carroo from maximizing his productivity. Despite these issues, he earned third-team All-Big Ten accolades from league media due to his playmaking ability.	Has desired NFL size. Targeted by his quarterbacks at a high rate over last three seasons and was up to the challenge. Consistently productive. Averaged over 20 yards per catch over last two seasons and 31 of his 217 catches went for 25-plus yards. Finished with 29 touchdowns over three seasons. Strong ball tracker who can adjust to off-target deep balls and run under them. Can sell cornerback on the vertical route and then break it off suddenly while working back to the throw. Natural, reliable hands catcher who snatches the ball away from his body. Able to make contested catches. Uses plus balance and footwork to accelerate out of his breaks and create separation. Improved his release against press coverage by varying approaches and improving initial footwork. Gets upfield immediately after the catch and has size to finish with an extra yard or two tacked on. Played in scheme that required him to be a willing and competitive run blocker. Team captain. Willing to play with pain. Missed two games due to high ankle sprain, but came back early and played hurt over final three games of the season.	His gaudy yards per catch numbers are a function of Rutgers play-­action passing attack more than his speed deep. Rarely outruns cornerbacks and struggles to get over the top and stack them. Is a little too upright into his routes and hip stiffness limits ability to run sharp out-breaking and in-breaking routes. Has had his struggles against physical, press­-man cover men with length. Was completely ineffective and nearly shut out in 2014 against Michigan State?s Trae Waynes. Scouts have concerns regarding Carroo's personal character and reliability. Suspended two games for his role in a simple assault charge involving a domestic dispute and missed the first half of the first game after being suspended for missing curfew.	\N	Consistently productive receiver with good size but pedestrian long speed. While Carroo benefited from Rutgers' offensive system, he was still producing at a high level despite the attention that was paid to him. Carroo will need to continue to sharpen his route running in order to improve his separation on the next level, but his size, hands and ability to block in the running game could land him in the middle rounds with a chance to become an eventual starter.	\N	25	5.33999999999999986	leonte-carroo	\N
2555216	Malcolm	Mitchell	4	72	198	10.5	Mitchell tore his ACL in the 2013 season opener, and fought back the last two seasons to become the outstanding player he has been early in his career in Athens (Freshman All-SEC pick, 85 catches for over 1,200 yards and eight scores in 2011-2012.) He finally started all 13 games in 2015, leading the Bulldogs in receiving (58-865, four TD). He?s not putting up huge numbers like Big 12 receivers because of the Bulldogs' offense, but scouts see Mitchell's sure hands and toughness over the middle, making him a reliable No. 2 or 3 option for a pro offense.	Made huge jump in explosive plays and yards per catch from 2014 to 2015. Has the ability to make some plays down the field with a quarterback who will take some shots. Adequate play speed and can vary tempo of his routes. Very good hip sink to stop quickly and open up to the quarterback. Route running shows promise. Smooth with change of direction and works back to the ball. Able to make sharp cuts out of breaks and does a nice job of selling double moves. Consistently tracks and high-­points downfield throws and is able to adjust to throws high, low and outside. Generally reliable hands and showed toughness in making catches where he know he was going to take a big shot.	Doesn?t have plus size or speed to consistently threaten outside cornerbacks. Speedy cornerbacks sat on his routes and showed little respect for his long speed. Can be knocked off schedule by physical cornerbacks. Must prove he can adjust routes without the noticeable slowing that the tape shows. Has room for improvement with leveraging of routes to create more separation for out-breaking routes. Will duck head and give away timing of when he?s going to sink his routes to man cornerbacks. Would like to see better separation ability underneath. Knee injuries slowed his career so his medicals could be a concern. Not as effective as a blocker in space as some teams will want.	Nelson Agholor	Mitchell was hampered by injuries in the past and inconsistent quarterback play this year, but there is no doubting his ball skills and smoothness as a route runner. His speed is just average and he doesn't get as much separation as teams like underneath, but he's tough, can make contested catches and has the type of personal and football character that will have scouts pulling for him in their draft rooms. Mitchell will be a 24-year-old rookie.	\N	83	5.33999999999999986	malcolm-mitchell	\N
2555217	Aaron	Green	2	70	203	8.375	Green averaged 7.1 yards per rush (922 yards, nine scores on just 129 carries) as a junior, so it's not hard to see why he earned second-team All-Big 12 notice. Though he regressed to the honorable mention category in 2015, his production actually increased (1,272 yards, 11 TD). The Nebraska transfer and nephew of NFL Pro Bowl cornerback Gary Green must convince teams he?s not too much of a bounce-outside runner to be an every-down workhorse.	Choppy, quick feet. Runs on the balls of his feet and is able to change direction suddenly. Production fell off some in 2015, but showed some explosive tendencies in 2014. Has good jump cut for lateral escapability. Not a burner, but has speed to the outside and can out­race defenders to the corner. At his best with wide stretch plays that allow him to hit the gas around the corner or shuffle and cut it into a developing crease on the perimeter. Ball security is good enough.	Plays like a 180 pound running back. Runs with very little power in his legs and is unable to break tackles or right the ship and stay upright when his feet get caught in the trash near the line of scrimmage. Not a willing runner between the tackles and goes out of his way to try and break it outside whenever he can. Hesitant through the hole. Feet come to sudden stop when contact is imminent. Loses balance at times when making sharp cuts. Not trustworthy in blitz protection. Appears to run out of apprehension over desire.	\N	Scat­back trying to function in a running game at TCU that asks him to be more complete. While Green has the foot quickness of an NFL running back, he doesn?t appear to have the stomach for what needs to be done between the tackles and doesn?t feature the pass­-catching prowess to stress defenses as a matchup back. Could be a long­shot to get drafted, but should make it into a camp.	"I had to reject him. Hands are just average and he's not a first or second down runner. He's got some quickness but I needed to see blazing speed to consider him as a draftable guy." -- NFC personnel director	63	4.95000000000000018	aaron-green	\N
2555218	Dan	Vitale	3	73	239	9.75	Northwestern's "superback" is a one-of-a-kind position in college football, and Vitale's (vuh-TAL-ee) intelligence, size, physicality, and receiving skills were made to fill that role. He?s consistently been a part of the passing game during his career (102 receptions for over 1,000 yards and seven scores his first three years), and when the Wildcats want to focus on the run, Vitale can open up holes for running backs from an H-back or in-line spot. He capped off his career with a second-team All-Big Ten effort in 2015, leading the team with 33 receptions for 355 yards and a career-high four scores.	Utilized at versatile "superback" position during his time at Northwestern. Has shown ability to line up in slot, from behind center and all points in ­between. Runs better routes than many of the wide outs in this draft. Able to catch throws in traffic and take the hit. Shows no hesitation to stick his nose in the hole and into his intended target as a blocker. Generally solid radar as a blocker. Consistently lands his strikes inside the framework of defender. Team-oriented and highly coachable leader.	Might be considered a too small for teams looking for a classic lead blocker. Thickly muscled and maxed out frame with little room for additional, functional mass. Missing length and overall mass to get into defender and control him throughout the rep. Not a true thumper as iso ­blocker. Slows feet at point of contact rather than accelerating through his intended target with force. Lacking desired athleticism outside of his frame to sustain as move blocker. Despite his plus route running, doesn?t have quickness out of breaks to gain separation as a receiver.	James Casey	Four-year starter who brings a great work ethic and leadership qualities to the table. Vitale's tape shows a multi-­dimensional player who may fit in with the changing face of hybrid football, but he doesn't really have an element of his game that he can hang his hat on as a true strength by NFL standards. Vitale can do many things for a team, but can he do them at a high level? Vitale's special teams play could be instrumental in making a team?s roster.	\N	36	4.84999999999999964	dan-vitale	\N
2555219	Daniel	Lasco	2	72	209	9.125	Coming off of a team MVP and honorable mention All-Pac-12 campaign in 2014 (1,115 rush yards, 12 touchdowns; 33-356 receiving), Lasco looked for a big senior year to finish off his career. Unfortunately, he couldn't stay healthy in 2015, playing in nine games due to hip and ankle injuries (three starts; 65-331 rushing, three TD; 4-24 receiving). Scouts already wondered if Lasco would stay healthy with a 6-1, 205-pound build, but he's not contact-shy. In fact, he led the team with 12 special teams tackles as a true freshman in addition to carrying the ball six times for 109 and a score.	Athletic short-strider with potential to make a quick cut to avoid contact. Inconsistent play speed, but does show a second gear to burst past a tackler. Has some ?get­away? in the open field when he sees daylight. Highly productive 2014 campaign creates hope that 2015 injury was primarily responsible for on-­field issues. Has adequate hands and was a weapon out of the backfield in 2014. Productive on cover teams at Cal and has potential to be special teams contributor.	Not an instinctive runner between the tackles. Slow to process development of running lanes and appears unable to make late decisions and keep the run alive. Needs to show more creativity as a runner. Leaves too many yards out on the field due to lack of vision. Too quick to give in and end the run. Suffered through a hip injury in 2015 that robbed him of effectiveness and confidence. Needs to run with more urgency and desire. Gears down rather than accelerates when contact is imminent. Yardage after contact numbers are below average.	\N	One­-year wonder who put himself on the map with a strong, overall performance in 2014 but suffered through a hip injury in 2015 and was unimpressive when he played. Lasco has some positive physical traits and might post some interesting combine numbers, but his lack of vision and inability to run with consistent physicality will be challenges when it comes to making an NFL roster.	\N	47	5.12999999999999989	daniel-lasco	\N
2555222	Devon	Johnson	2	72	238	9.25	It's not tough to see why "Rockhead" earned that moniker -- no one wants to get in the way of this 6-1, 243-pound freight train when he's healthy. The 2014 first-team All-Conference USA pick accumulated 1,767 yards and 17 touchdowns rushing as a junior after lining up for two years as a tight end. His receiving skills (12 catches, 218 yards, two scores in 2013) actually give him a chance to take on an H-back role. Unfortunately, Johnson could only play seven games (five starts) in 2015 due to a back injury (593 rush yards, five TD). So he'll need to prove his health before proving he can play on Sundays.	Big boy who is a straight banger. Nicknamed "Rockhead" which fits his running style. Will drop pads, accelerate and drive through would­-be tacklers. Has thick, powerful legs that he continues to churn through initial contact. Will take tacklers for a ride if they try and tackle him high. Put together a monster 2014 campaign with 29 carries for 15-plus yards. Makes early decisions and will hit the gas quickly. Has more juice around the corner than linebackers give him credit for. Play speed is good for his size and can hit a big run if he gets up a head of steam. Good inside zone runner who presses line of scrimmage then maintains a tight track off the hip of his blocker. Short-yardage winner. Was a terrific special teams cover man over first two seasons at Marshall.	A one-­decision runner. Reads the hole and then mashes the gas rather than continuing to look for the second move. Limited as a runner. Doesn't have the flexibility or loose hips for quick cutting and creativity at the line of scrimmage. Not as balanced as expected. Despite coming into Marshall as tight end, looks disinterested as a pass catcher and had minor production in that area despite having some ability. Needs to improve focus in pass protection. Ball security needs work after fumbling five times over last 290 carries. Missed six of final eight games in 2015 with a back injury.	Jerome Felton	Bruising back who was unable to prove to scouts that he could replicate his big 2014 campaign due to a back injury that bothered him for more than half the year. "Rockhead" is a power back who might have enough play speed to fit into a speciality role as goal line back and an immediate special teams contributor. While teams will certainly look at him as a fullback, his value lies in moving the chains and punishing second-level players.	\N	98	5.30999999999999961	devon-johnson	\N
2555223	Devontae	Booker	2	71	219	8.625	The former Washington State signee and junior-college star ran just 31 times in his first three games with the Utes in 2014 -- then he ran for an average of 130 yards a game through the rest of the season. Booker followed up that performance with a second-team All-Pac-12 senior campaign (1,261 yards, 11 TD in 10 games) before a torn meniscus sidelined him early. His power, quickness, elusiveness in the hole, and receiving ability (80 receptions in 2014-2015) give him an excitement factor lacking from most collegiate backs.	Patient runner but decisive when he sees the crease. Hits it through the crease with determination. Flashes above-average feel for the way running lanes shift and change, and he flows with it making the smart choices to avoid tacklers and extend runs. Features excellent vision. Doesn?t get caught dancing very often and usually ends the run on his terms with low pads and forward lean. Can maintain play speed when changing direction and cutting. Has crisp footwork approaching the line of scrimmage and can dodge and dart around penetration to create yardage opportunities. Elusive second-level runner able to string together a slew of moves in succession. Effective pass catcher with soft hands. Rarely leaves the field. Dependable short yardage back in college. Willing to step up and do his part in pass protection.	Doesn?t have the top­-end speed to be a ?chunk play? runner. Full­-time running back, but on the borderline of size NFL teams look for from a full-­time back. May not be able to add more weight onto his frame without compromising quickness and his average speed. Cut down on his fumbles this season but had six last year which could be a potential concern at the NFL level. His 12­-yard runs could become 4-­yard runs thanks to average get­away speed.	Jeremy Langford	Rhythm runner who has experience in a pro­-style running game and who gets better with the more carries he has. Booker is a three-down running back who has the toughness and determination to grind out short yardage while possessing the vision and footwork to create for himself when near the line of scrimmage or the second level. Booker isn?t fast, but he plays at a consistent speed and should have enough quickness to be consistently productive as an NFL starting running back.	\N	80	5.70000000000000018	devontae-booker	\N
2555224	Ezekiel	Elliott	2	72	225	10.25	Elliott's dad, Stacy, played linebacker for the Missouri Tigers and was on the unfortunate end of the infamous "fifth down" play in which Colorado scored a game-winning touchdown (which might not have crossed the goal line) after officials in charge of the down markers failed to mark a play. "Zeke" has had much more success than heartbreak during his athletic career, however. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch High School Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, Elliott also had the speed to win four state titles in track and field (100 meters, 200 meters, 110 high hurdles, and 300 hurdles). He contributed as a reserve in his freshman year in Columbus (30-262, two TD rushing) before hitting it big in 2014, finishing with three straight 200-yard games, including two against Alabama which (scoring six times in those two contests) helped the Buckeyes win the national title. Elliott carried forth the momentum from the end of his honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore year into 2015, when he received the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year award (1,821 yards, 23 TD rushing; 27-206 receiving) and second-team All-American notice from the Associated Press and USA Today. Unfortunately, Ohio State's home loss to Michigan State on a terrible weather day, in which Elliott received only 15 carries (complaining to the media afterwards about his lack of totes), prevented the team from defending its title in the College Football Playoff. His 149-yard, four touchdown effort against Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl put a happy ending on his career, however, allowing him to finish second all-time in rushing yards for the storied Buckeyes program.	Elite combination of vision and decisiveness. Instinctive, short strider with instant reaction time. Has a bona fide jump-­cut to elude penetration in the backfield and enough burst to elude chasers when he bounces runs to the outside. Able to change directions with no hesitation or wasted motion and is always headed forward. Has innate feel for developing blocks in space and is excellent at setting his blocks up and accelerating from behind them when the linebacker is trapped. When it's gridlocked inside, finds yards on his own. Rocked up physique but still maintains loose hips for agility. Exceptional balance through contact and takes tacklers for a ride. Has a "come at me, bro!" mentality as a runner. Loves to end runs on his physical terms. Uses lead shoulder as a weapon, but plays with outstanding ball security. Looks to absolutely bludgeon defenders as a lead blocker and is often successful. Able pass catcher who adjusts to throws and can do something with it after the catch.	Strapped it up with a heavy workload over last two seasons including over 600 touches. Defenders land big shots on him. Appears to be too willing to put himself through the meat grinder rather than avoiding certain collisions. Understanding when to attack and when to elude may take time for him. Can sharpen his pass routes a bit and has room for improvement as a pass blocker. On second level, gets on top of defenders before he has a chance to gather himself into a position to evade a tackle. Questions arose about his maturity after complaining about lack of carries in Michigan State game.	Edgerrin James	Elite, three­-down running back who has the ability to excel in every facet of the game. Elliott has rare combination of size, athleticism, pass-catching and blocking skills and his competitive nature is always bubbling on the surface. While he's had to handle a heavy workload over the last two seasons, Elliot should still come out of the gates as one of the most productive young running backs in the league.	\N	37	7.20000000000000018	ezekiel-elliott	\N
2555225	Jeff	Seybold	2	68	213	\N	Seybold expected to start his career on a scholarship with Division II Nebraska-Omaha. But after his redshirt season in 2010, the football program was shut down so he took his game to Pittsburg State, across the Nebraska-Kansas border. He's also had difficulty staying healthy at PSU, playing in eight games as freshman (54-273 rushing, one TD), missing time with a groin injury. His 2012 season was short-circuited due to injury after only two games, and in 2014, he started five games but a foot injury cost him the rest of the year (47-233 rushing, two TD). Seybold's 2013 season was his best, carrying the ball 201 times for 1,434 yards and 22 touchdowns (19-129 receiving, one TD) on his way to first team All-MIAA and honorable mention All-American honors. Seybold was an honorable mention All-MIAA pick in his sixth and final collegiate season, covering 696 yards and scoring six times on 151 totes.	Built low to the ground and runs with plus balance and cutback ability. Shows good vision for the most part and is decisive in space picking the correct running lane most of the time when faced with a choice. Good feel as an outside runner. Has a second gear that he'll activate to turn the corner. Very natural pass catcher with soft hands and wiggle to become a problem for tacklers after the catch. Catches the ball well enough that a switch to wide receiver as a pro could at least be considered. Has a nose for the end zone when he gets close.	Short, but lacking the lower body power seen in many shorter, more compact runners. Is a hesitant inside runner. Approaches the line of scrimmage with too much caution and not enough play speed. Will duck his head and wait to take a hit when squeezing through an interior hole rather than bursting with confidence to daylight. Lacking the expected twitch out of his jump cuts for quick acceleration from trouble. Not a tackle breaker and shows little to no interest in getting his nose dirty in pass protection. Seybold missed seven games in 2014 with a foot injury and almost the entire 2012 campaign with a season-­ending injury.	\N	Productive Division II runner with the ability to score as a runner and pass catcher. Seybold isn?t physical enough between the tackles to generate serious consideration on first and second downs, and despite his pass-catching acumen, may not be an effective enough blocker to find the field on third downs. He has some talent, but fit could be a difficult obstacle to overcome.	\N	345	4.84999999999999964	jeff-seybold	\N
2555234	Tyler	Ervin	2	70	192	9.125	At his size, Ervin looks more like a slot receiver than a running back. Spartans coaches got him the ball in the backfield regularly the past two years, however, and it paid dividends as he led the team in rushing in 2014 (888 yards, four scores) and 2015 (1,469 yards, 13 touchdowns). Ervin's likely to play a rusher/receiver/returner role in the Dexter McCluster mold on Sundays, as he caught 73 passes for 642 yards the past two seasons in addition to his rushing work. His ability as a kick returner (2,374 career yardage, three scores) should also earn him credit among scouts.	Short-­strider in tight confines with ability to make sudden directional change. Despite lanky frame, doesn?t run with any fear between the tackles and doesn't look to bounce runs unnecessarily. Combines smoothness with quick reaction time to avoid traffic in the backfield and slalom his way through shifting, fluid creases along the line of scrimmage. Plus lateral escapability. Quality hands and can function as pass catcher with some matchup potential. Very good play speed and can punch the gas to top speed quickly. High-­knee runner who can gain yardage in chunks if run fits break down. Scored three touchdowns on kickoffs over freshman and sophomore year and has returned kicks all four seasons.	Thin, angular frame that isn't built for sustaining contact. Runs come to a screeching halt against quality, bodied­-up tackle attempts. Balance through contact is poor and has trouble grinding legs through arm tackles. Hits from the side cause him to go flying. Not a one­-cut runner. Will take an extra step or two to gear down and cut. Size and strength limitations hinder chances of being a true, third down option at running back. Limited in his routes and times looked like he was going through the motions if he didn?t expect to get ball. On gap plays, needs to be a little less patient and a little more urgent in approach to the line of scrimmage.	Akeem Hunt	Ervin is a long-­legged, linear runner with the vision and demeanor to be a first down runner, but the thin- frame and poor play strength that will force him into becoming a change of pace running back who will need to make his mark in open spaces when given his opportunities. With Ervin's lack of size in blitz protection, his best chance to make a team, initially, will be as a kick returner.	\N	115	5.11000000000000032	tyler-ervin	\N
2555226	Johnathan	Gray	2	70	211	\N	Gray's career was not as prolific as was expected coming to Austin as the top high school recruit in the country who twice earned the National Mr. Football award (205 touchdowns, 10,889 rush yards). He earned honorable mention All-Big 12 honors (710 rush yards, three touchdowns) as a freshman, but tore his right Achilles tendon halfway through his sophomore season. Gray just began to show glimpses of his explosive running style near the end of 2014 (637 yards, seven touchdowns), but couldn't really translate that success as a 10-game starter as a senior (123 carries, 489 yards, three touchdowns).	Looks the part and understands the craft of running the football. Decisive runner. Feet are just adequate. Has experience in a pro-­style rushing attack has decent feel and vision in both gap and zone scheme rushing attacks. Runs with bend and good pad level. Is willing to drop a shoulder and lean into contact in an effort to deliver a blow. Played special teams his senior year and might be able to expand his special teams potential if given the chance. Hands are average, but can be used out of the backfield. Will not shy away from contact. On outside zone plays, showed a second gear to burst around edge, when sealed, and can press the line of scrimmage before making cuts. Unselfish with a good work ethic.	Lacks creativity and elusiveness. Doesn't really possess much suddenness in his game and struggles to bounce runs laterally when clear lanes aren?t available. Below average top-­end speed and can be plodding at times. Suffered Achilles injury as a sophomore and there are concerns in scouting community that he lost some burst after that. Usually gets just what is blocked. Has rounded cuts rather than crisp sharp ones. Isn?t much of a tackle breaker and averaged 1.7 yards after initial contact over the last three years which is a disappointing total.	Chris Ogbonnaya	Johnathan Gray came to college as one of the most highly decorated runners in the nation, but will leave as the second best running back on his team. Scouts appreciate Gray?s professionalism and work ethic, but his issue on the next level comes in terms of slotting. He appears to lack the overall talent to be an every­-down runner and he doesn?t fit as a short-yardage specialist or a third down back.	"He hasn't had much room to run since he's been there but he also can't make yards on his own. I saw him play in high school and the guy from high school was more explosive than what you see now. I guess the injury did it, I don't know." ­-- NFC regional scout	19	4.83999999999999986	johnathan-gray	\N
2555227	Jonathan	Williams	2	71	220	\N	Williams was a second-team all-conference performer in 2014 with 1,190 yards and 12 touchdowns rushing, despite the fact that he shared carries with junior Alex Collins for the second straight year (he had 900 yards and four touchdowns as a sophomore). Williams missed the 2015 regular season after undergoing foot surgery, but decided he was better off entering the league instead of taking advantage of a redshirt (he played 11 games, starting two, as a true freshman). The thickly built and athletic Williams has the strength to return from this injury and excel as an NFL rookie.	Loose hips and quick feet are his calling card. Crafty with outstanding lateral movement to side­step tacklers in the backfield, in the hole and on the second level. Light feet allow for immediate actions and reactions when needed. Forced 44 missed tackles in 2014. Has excellent instincts. Great feel through the hole maintaining distance from tacklers and finds the best running lane possible most of the time. Limited tread ­wear with just 406 carries at Arkansas. Sets up his blocks well and runs with good balance through contact and an ability to run through arm tackles. Played in physical running game and will finish runs stronger than most slashing backs. Dependable in short yardage with the fortitude for short yardage situations. Three-down running back with soft hands out of the backfield. Willing to do his part in pass protection.	Needs to play with consistent burst and decisiveness. Spoiled between massive Arkansas offensive line that blew open gaping lanes that he won't see in the pros. Against Georgia (2014), made bad decisions to break inside runs outside because lanes were tighter than usual. At times, got too cute in the hole rather than planting and bursting upfield. Thin calves. Could use a little more thickness in his legs. Missed entire 2014 season after surgery to repair a left foot injury in August. Must get better at protecting football at point of impact. Lost five fumbles in 2014.	T.J. Yeldon	Has enough size, heart and talent to be a three-down running back, but was a proven commodity as a fresh runner in a committee approach at Arkansas. Williams is one of the more creative runners in tight quarters that you will find in this draft, but teams won't have to sacrifice too much toughness in order to take advantage of his slashing style. Williams' physicals at the combine will be huge since teams are justifiably concerned when the long term health of running backs who sustain foot injuries.	\N	89	5.57000000000000028	jonathan-williams	\N
2555228	Josh	Ferguson	2	69	198	\N	Ferguson never had a 1,000-rushing yard season in his career, but he's been invaluable to Illinois' offense when given the chance. He produced more than 1,000 yards of total offense in 2013 and 2014, including 1,162 as a junior (735 rushing, 427 receiving on 50 receptions), and scored 21 total touchdowns in 2013-2014. Ferguson missed three games with a shoulder injury as a senior, but still nearly reached four digits of rushing-receiving yards (988 total, five TD). Ferguson isn't the biggest back in the draft class, but his explosiveness and elusiveness are perfect for teams looking for a dual threat in the backfield.	Electric short-area acceleration from one of the most "sudden" backs in this draft. Possesses tremendously quick feet and seems to glide rather than run. Can make cuts on a dime. Can string together move after move with subtle direction changes, sharp jump cuts and wicked spin moves. Tacklers spend more time corralling him than hitting him with clean shots. Blazing speed to turn the corner and hit a "chunk yardage" run. Dangerous weapon in the passing game. Used to mismatch linebackers in coverage and was able to run away from them out of his breaks and after the catch. Can adjust to difficult throws in space and has desired hands to become a factor from the slot.	Smallish scat back who would much rather bounce his run outside than commit between the tackles. Unable to break tackles and finish runs falling forward. Fumbled the ball an astounding six times over 145 carries in 2014 with an additional fumble as a receiver. Has lapses of indecisiveness and vision fails him at times. At times, will do too much dancing if there isn?t a clearly blocked running lane. Always looking to hit a big play rather than understanding when to let a play go.	Ronnie Hillman	Small and lean waterbug of a running back. Ferguson's ability to change direction instantaneously and create explosive yardage as a runner or pass catcher could make him a dangerous weapon in the hands of the right NFL team. Ferguson has the hands and route running potential to be considered as a slot receiver option to go along with being a change of pace back. Ferguson won't rack up a high number of touches in the pros, but he has the playmaking ability to make a game-changing play here or there.	\N	30	5.38999999999999968	josh-ferguson	\N
2555229	Kenneth	Dixon	2	70	215	9.5	For a couple of days, Dixon was the leading touchdown scorer in FBS history. Even though Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds bested Dixon?s 87 scores in his final game, Tech?s top dog had an outstanding career. He earned first-team All-Conference USA honors in 2015 (1,070 rush yds, 467 receiving yards, 26 total TD) despite missing two games with an ankle injury. Dixon had earned first-team all-conference notice in the WAC as a true freshman in 2012 (1,194 yards, 27 rush TD) and second-team All-Conference USA the last two years as he hit 1,000 yards rushing (1,299) in 2014 and 917 as a sophomore while fighting a knee injury. That sort of consistency is a rare feat for a college back.	Hungry runner who almost never gives in to the defender. Light on his feet using outstanding jump ­cut and lateral quickness to sidestep danger in the backfield and create a positive play. Elusiveness on second level often leaves tacklers grasping at air. Able to string moves together and hit the explosive play. Despite being keyed on, still creates yardage for himself. Determined and competitive. Accelerates through initial contact and squeezes carries for everything he can. Averaged almost twice as many yards per carry after first contact (3.3) than before first contact (1.7). Greedy eater when endzone in his sights with 39 rushing touchdowns since 2014. Quick recognition of defensive flow and adjusts running lanes accordingly. Decisive runner with plus burst and ability to charge it up to his top speed instantly. Has very good feel for running lanes and tacklers and is able to navigate both without much wasted movement. Violent finisher for his size and enjoys thumping corners and safeties. Reliable pass catcher who can hurt teams out of the backfield.	Very average thickness through lower half. Struggled with a knee injury in 2013 and missed two games in 2015 with an ankle injury. Physical running style could lead to durability concerns. Not as likely to slip out of side doors against substantially better competition. Average long speed makes him more slasher than home-run hitter. Competitive resolve leads him to try and do too much on some snaps. Base narrows in space and can be susceptible to shoestring tackles. Aggression and competitiveness as a runner isn?t as readily available in pass protection. Needs to improve ball security. Has fumbled 13 times over last three seasons.	Thomas Rawls	Highly determined runner with a strong desire to compete through the whistle on every snap. Dixon possesses outstanding feet with exciting suddenness in his change of direction, but he?s very willing to finish his runs with authority and has a knack for finding the endzone. Dixon has all the traits of being a quality, three­-down starter in the NFL but his frame and suspect pass protection could be long-term concerns.	\N	111	5.70000000000000018	kenneth-dixon	\N
2555230	Kenyan	Drake	2	73	210	9.75	Drake's explosiveness as an all-purpose weapon is somewhat tempered by his injury history. He suffered a broken leg against Ole Miss in 2014, and then fractured his right arm trying to make a tackle on special team this fall. Drake did return a couple of weeks after that injury, however, and flashed his slashing style (averaged six yards a carry for his career) who also provides good hands out of the backfield (12.5 yards per reception). He also showed in the national championship game he can be a threat as a kickoff returner, taking one back 95 yards for a crucial score. A healthy Drake could be a great find in the mid-to-late rounds.	Can be exhausting watching him because feet never stop moving -- ever. Able to elude defenders. Features second gear to burst through line and can string together moves in open field. Will press line of scrimmage effectively to set up his blocks. Legs keep churning through contact. Willing to aggressively finish runs. Will gain more yards post contact than expected. Very quick feet with the lateral agility to escape from heavy traffic and bounce it outside. Used at times as slot receiver and has ability to be effective pass catcher in pros. Was kick returner, blocked a punt and made several tackles while playing special teams at Alabama.	Can be almost too frenetic. Mind seems to be racing with ball in his hands and he will show a lack of patience at times. Responds to what is in front of him rather than anticipating what is coming. Inconsistent hands with five drops to 44 catches during his career. Can get too dancey when asked to play downhill. Tendency to cut runs towards sidelines rather than back into middle of the field. Change of pace runner without a go-­to value. Suffered broken leg in 2014 and broken arm in 2015.	Charles Sims	Drake become the forgotten running back with Derrick Henry's Heisman winning season, but he has good size, quick feet can catch the football. Drake's draft stock could depend on whether or not teams envision him as quality backup who could become part of a committee approach. Drake's physical traits and special teams could make him a good value selection early in the third day.	"He's a player who you have to have a plan for because he's not an every­-down back and he's too lean to be in around the goal line.

2555231	Paul	James	2	71	206	\N	When James is healthy and getting the ball, he's tough to stop. James can wiggle his way through a crease, power through arm tackles and has enough of a burst to break off big runs. Unfortunately, he hasn't been healthy often enough the past two seasons, missing six weeks in 2013 (still gaining 881 yards and scoring nine touchdowns) and then tearing his right ACL in the fourth week of his junior year (363 yards, five touchdowns in four games). Although he started 10 games as a senior, he was part of a three-headed committee so he didn?t put up big numbers (544 yards on just 99 carries, five scores). Still, he has the talent to play at the next level.	Leader in the locker room. Has some ability to side­step traffic in the tight quarters and get upfield. Able to slalom back and forth from lane to lane as they develop. While he runs a bit upright, his body control and balance are unaffected. Becomes a more effective back once he gets past the line of scrimmage with improved vision and a north-­south demeanor with little wasted motion. Can lay a strong shoulder into rushers when chip blocking. Competent runner in zone scheme.	Suffered an ACL tear in 2014 that appears to have slowed him from his already average play speed pre-injury. Doesn?t possess the acceleration to threaten the edge as an outside runner. More of a one­-speed runner who lacks burst to and through the crease. Has the instincts to make an initial defender miss, but missing the lateral quickness to make it count afterwards. Seems to take a high percentage of squared- up, hard tackles. Lacks consistent awareness in routes out of backfield and might not be good enough in protection or as a pass catcher to be a third down consideration.	\N	Run­-of­-the­-mill running back possessing decent size, but no bankable traits to hang your hat on as an evaluator. James? history with injuries certainly won?t help him and his 2014 ACL tear likely robbed him of some of his quickness in 2015. He has enough talent to get into a camp, or maybe have someone take a late-­round shot with him, but making a team?s ?53? could be very difficult.	"I wanted to really like him this season and give him a draftable grade because I like the kid and his resilience, but I just don't see enough quickness." -- AFC North scout	25	4.87999999999999989	paul-james	\N
2555232	Shaquille	Powell	2	70	205	\N	Most college football players spend the summer between their junior and senior years working in the classroom, weight room and on the practice field to prepare for their last campaign. Powell spent most of his, however, grieving for his younger brother, seven-year-old Malachi Briggs, who died after battling kidney cancer. He returned to campus before the 2015 season, and played well with a heavy heart. Powell started 11 games, running for 542 yards and three touchdowns on 125 carries while having a major role in the passing game (35-212, two TD). He had started 11 games the previous season, as well, leading the team in rushing (134-618, two TD; 18-154 receiving, one TD). He also contributed as a freshman (28-93 rush, 1-4 receiving) and sophomore (62-344 rushing, 2 TD; 8-90 receiving, one TD). Powell fumbled once in his college career, versus Virginia Tech in his freshman year.	Possesses decent initial, short­-area quickness with a jump­cut to avoid early trouble. Decisive inside runner with the vision to make quality hole choices when needed. Low center of gravity. Will run through arm tackles and is rarely knocked off balance at contact. Churns legs to maximize his runs. Competitive and tough. Doesn?t give the ball away with fumbles. Solid hands out of backfield and gets upfield after catch. Willing to step up and meet the challenge in blitz pickup.	One speed runner. Plays hard, but limited by average athleticism. Shows some hip tightness. Takes a little while to gear down on cuts and doesn?t plant and go on outside run. Will duck head into contact losing immediate vision of space ahead. Can?t get to the tough backside cut­back lanes. Athletic linebackers can close him out on runs to the perimeter. Missing desired wiggle on second level. Lacking big back size to go with his demeanor.	\N	Time­share running back in college who is long on heart and toughness, but short on explosiveness and NFL­-caliber athleticism. Powell?s college stats won?t jump out at anyone, but his ball security, toughness and ability to compete on third down and special teams is worth a trip into camp as a free agent.	"He's a tough little guy. I think he believes he's bigger than he actually is and he's got some tape where he's knocking defensive ends down with that shoulder dip at contact. Wish he were a better athlete." -- AFC East scout	2	4.86000000000000032	shaquille-powell	\N
2555233	Tra	Carson	2	71	227	9.25	Carson is a load with just enough speed to make linebackers regret leaving a gap for him to run through. The transfer from Oregon (after only one season) started just four games in 2014, but still led the team with 581 rushing yards. His Offensive MVP performance in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl (133 yards) portended his strong senior campaign which saw him cover 1,165 yards and score seven times on the ground as well as contribute regularly in the passing game (29-183, one TD).	Physical runner who looks to send messages. Uses his lead shoulder as a weapon to dole out punishment. Has a good feel for contact and will lean into tacklers allowing him to maintain balance and continue the run. His feet never stop churning. Has just enough wiggle to avoid an occasional tackler with slight hip turn. Tough in pass protection and is willing to stick his nose in and absorb a lick to keep his quarterback clean. Really good hands. Was outstanding high school basketball player. Has potential to be a third-down back in the pros. Possesses a great deal of value on special teams as a punt protector and cover man.	Despite having some explosive traits, he's limited by some hip tightness. Needs several baby­ steps to slow down and gather himself to make a sharp cut. Will show some hesitation through the hole and doesn't appear confident in his vision. Missing the desired feel for running games. Left too many yards on the field on inside zone plays because he didn't maintain a tight track. Not enough elusiveness to make NFL tacklers miss. Power approach limits his value.	Tim Hightower	Carson doesn't possess the skill level necessary to be a starter or even part of a combination of backs to lead the charge for a team, but his toughness and ability to grind it out in short yardage gives him some value. With his hands and blocking, Carson has immediate third down potential and his ability to shine on special teams only strengthens his chance to be drafted and make a 53-man roster.	"Really tough guy. I know coaches on that staff who like the person as much as the player. You know he's ready to challenge your guys on every carry, but he's not the kind of runner who you fear if that makes sense." -- SEC West coach	20	5.23000000000000043	tra-carson	\N
2555235	Adolphus	Washington	10	75	301	9.875	Washington showed himself ready to play for his senior season by racking up four sacks in Ohio State's spring game. Following up an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior season (10.5 tackles for loss, 4.5 sacks), played even better in 2015. He earned second-team All-Conference honors from league coaches and media, as well as first-team All-American by the Sporting News (49 tackles, seven for loss, four sacks). Unfortunately, his judgment and maturity may be questioned by scouts after he was suspended for Ohio State's bowl game for soliciting a vice squad officer in early December.	Agile and athletic. Can get off snap quickly and has length to fluster interior blockers if coached up. Active interior pass rusher who uses head fakes and foot quickness to open doors to a guard?s edge. Able to string together pass rush moves and counters. At his best on the move. Can be tough to reach and secure for offensive linemen thanks to lateral quicks. When rush has stalled, will gather himself and look to get his hands in the passing lane. Plus change of direction talent and can hound a runner who tries to bounce it outside. Adequate power at the point of attack and has experience as both a one and two gap defender. Productive tackler with extended tackle radius to get in on the action. Will win if consistently single blocked.	Thin from his knees down. Pad level stays high. Looks top-heavy in his play. Upright movements limit effectiveness in twists. Doesn?t own his spot in the grass consistently enough thanks to leverage issues. Needs added strength in lower half and to play with wider base to improve balance. Play was ragged and fatigued against Michigan State in the fourth quarter when his team needed him most. Not even a participation ribbon as a bull ­rusher. Needs to play square to the line of scrimmage and utilize his punch. Was much bigger factor in offensive backfield in 2014 than he was this year. Inconsistent motor. Arrested for solicitation in a prostitution sting in December and was suspended from the Fiesta Bowl.	Wallace Gilberry	Washington has the size and athleticism that should get him taken within the first two days of the draft, but his issues with contact balance might be something that always hinders his ability to reach his true potential. Washington can become an effective interior pass rusher if he can force himself to play with better knee bend, but he must play with more consistent urgency or could turn into just another guy in the rotation rather than a full-­time starter.	\N	37	5.59999999999999964	adolphus-washington	\N
2555236	David	Dean	10	73	290	\N	A three-year starter for the Cavaliers, Dean provided quickness inside, as well as strength, belying his smallish frame. In his redshirt sophomore season, Dean made 49 tackles, 7.5 for loss and four sacks from the interior. The former four-star recruit from Virginia Beach earned honorable mention All-ACC honors for his play the following two years, starting all 12 games of the Cavaliers' contests in 2014 (40 tackles, eight for loss, one sack, interception) and 2015 (49 stops, nine for loss, 4.5 sacks).	Gets off to quick starts after the snap. Has experience as a shade-­nose and 3­-technique. Barrel-­chested and broad through his waist. Has good hips for an interior lineman. Able to chase ball and occasionally capture runner from the backside. Has short arms, but makes most of his length by getting into blocker first. Plays with violent forceful hands, using them to slap and club at blocker?s hands. When pad level is right, can get a decisive, early win. Adequate play strength. Plays with coordinated feet and hands and can flash as a pass rusher from time to time.	Pad level is inconsistent. Plays too high as a two-­gapping defensive tackle and can be bounced off his spot just a bit. Lack of arm length shows up during bull-­rush attempts. If he doesn?t win early in the rep, he tends to fade and give in. The play­making flashes on tape are surrounded with periods of ineffectiveness. Can stack, but doesn?t shed quickly enough. Needs to improve conditioning and consistency of motor on every snap. Straight-­legged play prevents him from reaching full potential. Might not have a natural position fit for many NFL defenses.	\N	Dean is a strong player with good balance and a sturdy base, but when he plays tall (which is too often) rather than bending to create leverage, he robs himself of the aforementioned strengths. If he can get his pad level right, he has enough talent and strength to be a rotational 4-­3 nose who can also be disruptive as a pass rusher.	\N	8	5.16999999999999993	david-dean	\N
2555237	Gerald	Dixon, Jr.	10	74	325	\N	If you're not familiar with the Dixon brothers, they are both sons of former NFL linebacker Gerald Dixon and were born five months apart. They both play on the defensive line for the Gamecocks, but they have different mothers. "Junior" is a massive nose tackle prospect who can eat blocks and shows better foot quickness than you'd expect for a two-down player. The two-year starter should catch the eyes of scouts for 3-4 teams that are looking for depth up front.	Lateral quickness is average to above average. Plays with adequate body control and balance thanks to his sturdy base. Able to base up and anchor against double teams and down blocks. Hand usage is OK and can get extension while peeking in as two­-gap plugger. Father, Gerald, played at South Carolina and was a 10-­year NFL veteran.	Reaction is slow off the ball. Gets over-­blocked and hooked by smaller centers on zone and stretch plays without fighting through it. Slow reaction time causes overcompensation in pursuit which leads to abandoning gap. Gives very little as a pass rusher. Has no go­-to rush moves or counters. Motor doesn't run as hot as it should considering amount of rest he gets with defensive tackle rotation.	\N	Big, two-gap nose tackle with the ability to handle double teams, but still enough athleticism to pursue plays down the line. Dixon doesn?t play with the every-down fire and intensity that he needs to, which is why his production has been lean. His size and strength should get him a look in an NFL camp.	\N	85	4.90000000000000036	gerald-dixon, jr.	\N
2555238	Jarran	Reed	10	75	307	10.5	The East Mississippi Community College transfer didn?t light up the stat sheet in 2014 (6.5 tackles for loss, one sack in 2014) but looked to be an ascending talent. Though his numbers weren?t much different this year (56 tackles, 4.5 for loss, one sacks), SEC media named him second-team All-SEC because of his utterly disruptive play whether playing between the guards or heads-up on a tackle in the Tide?s feared front line. Reed was arrested for DUI in the summer of 2014, but should overcome any character concerns to become a starter at the next level.	Able to pack plenty of strength into his well-­built frame. Plays with bend, leverage and plus core power. Two-­gap machine who can eat blocks and come back for more. Rarely beaten at point of attack by single blocks. As an edge setter, grows roots and prevents running lanes from developing in gaps. Has catcher?s mitts for hands. Arms are a little short for the position but his hand quickness into blocker?s frame and instant arm extension make his arm length irrelevant. Engages, controls and slides down the line looking to finish the run before it gets started. Great vision and instincts to find ball quickly. Reads running back?s lane choice and discards blocker with excellent timing. Run down specialist posting tremendous two-­year production with 108 tackles despite playing in only 55 percent of the total snaps. Charted with no broken tackles or missed tackles for the entire season. Overcome adversity along road to success at Alabama.	Ineffective pass rusher. Was subbed out for on obvious passing downs. Straight-­line pass rusher unable to turn a corner and generate heat inside the pocket. Had just two sacks and sixteen quarterback pressures during his two years with Alabama. Bull­rush is missing. Average foot quickness and lacking upfield explosion out of stance to play in a one­-gap scheme. His hand work is very average as a pass rusher.	Eddie Goldman	Reed is an elite run defender with the lower body strength to command his gap, but the instincts and timing to be productive as a tackler rather than just a space ­eater. Reed?s lack of pass rushing ability creates a potential glass­ ceiling on his draft stock; however, teams looking for a battle-­tested run ­stuffer will find an instant upgrade who should be able to come in and start immediately if needed.	\N	88	6.19000000000000039	jarran-reed	\N
2555291	Ryan	Brown	9	78	266	\N	\N	Hard worker in classrooms and on the field. Very aware of screen passes developing and covers them up. Two-year starter who was also an active contributor on special teams. Plays with hand up and down. Comes off the ball with decent quickness. Tall with good arm length. Invited to play in East-West Shrine Game.	Lack of feel or awareness for trap blocks coming across the formation. No functional play strengths. Can?t generate penetration or push. Once blockers latch on, he?s finished. Straight legged player who gets widened when trying to set edges and who lacks the movement to change direction and get after the passer.	\N	Brown has the long-­levered frame that is often predictive of an edge bending pass rusher, but that is not the case with his play. Brown plays entirely too upright to corner with effectiveness as a rusher and is lacking in play strength necessary to hold his ground against the run.	\N	92	4.5	ryan-brown	\N
2555239	Javon	Hargrave	10	73	309	9.625	Typically, 300-pound defensive tackles are not among the nation's leaders in sacks -- even at the FCS level. But the 2014 and 2015 Associated Press All-American and MEAC Defensive Player of the Year in 2014 ranked third in the FCS with 16 as a junior -- a whopping six against Bethune-Cookman, a figure that tied the FCS single-game record -- and 13.5 more this fall. He also had 45.5 tackles for loss over those two seasons. His size and brute strength overwhelmed his competition throughout his career, even racking up good numbers in his FCS Freshman All-American (45 tackles, 4.5 for loss) and sophomore (12.5 tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks).	Thick bubble and burly thighs. Compact frame allows him to play low and dip around the corner when playing in gaps. Dominated his level of competition. Surprising foot quickness with an adequate spin move. Plays with quick burst upfield and into blockers. Plus motor and effort and willing to pursue around the field. Better upper body power than in his trunk. Inconsistent with his hands, but when he uses them, they are effective. Raw, but has potential and flashes playmaking ability.	Squatty with short arms and tiny hands. Very raw as a pass rusher relying on athleticism over moves and counters. Lacks instincts and feel for the position. Doesn?t anticipate down blocks and can be knocked around because of it. Doesn?t play with enough anchor. Lack of length could become a non­starter if he doesn?t play with great quickness. Feel for the game and technique could take extended time to learn.	\N	Raw, but athletic one­-gap penetrator who dominated his level of competition with effort and quickness. Credited with 16 sacks and 23.5 tackles for losses, Hargrave has the ability to play on the other side of the ball, but the jump in talent and size could be challenging for him. Hargrave is better than a ?project," but he will require patience and much more coaching to realize his potential.	"You don't think much of him going in because of his size, and then he's all over the place.

2555240	Matthew	Ioannidis	10	75	299	10.125	Ioannidis (eye-an-NYE-dis) has been a valuable performer from the Owls since halfway through his freshman year, when the team took off his redshirt. Whether lined up outside or inside, his power and hustle impact nearly every play. The 2014 second-team All-American Athletic Conference pick (11 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks) and 2015 first-team All-Conference pick in 2015 (11.5 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks, five pass break-ups) has added bulk to his frame every season.	Can match pure power with just about anyone on the field and carries almost no bad weight on his frame. Grows roots and refuses to budge against many double teams he faced. Hard to run at his gap. Can push and pull blockers and unhinge from point of attack when it?s time to tackle. Plays with quick reaction time off the snap and gets hands into blockers quickly. Generally good knee bend when battling the man in front of him. Can get to shoulder of blocker and get him leaning and then uses club/hump move to knock him off balance and attack the vacated position. Powerful base and very rarely off his feet. Can power through redirect blocks and maintain a path for the ball. Has good feel for screen plays and chases them down down with great intensity. Will occasionally show a spin move that is reasonably effective to the left more than to the right. Uses violent powerful clubbing movement to prevent blockers from staying locked in on their block. One of the unquestioned leaders of the team.	Muscle-­bound slow­-twitch player. Success may be limited to ability to win with power. Is a little stiff in his lateral movement and possesses an average burst upfield as a pass rusher. Labored effort in twist game and won?t surprise offensive linemen when he comes rumbling around the corner. Can push the pocket, but is not a finisher as a pass rusher and his role in pass rushing situations as a pro is unclear. Slow lateral movement off snap limits his effectiveness playing in the gap and may limit him in terms of scheme.	Nick Hayden	Muscle shark who never shrinks in the face of physicality or doing the dirty work that needs to get done. Ioannidis isn't a bad athlete, he's just a little bit limited due to a lack of twitch. With power and toughness to spare, he is at his best as a block-­eating two-­gap player who can anchor against the run and who can generate decent push in the pocket when called on as a pass rusher. He has the looks of a starter in a 3-­4 defense and a rotational tackle in a 4­-3.	\N	27	5.57000000000000028	matthew-ioannidis	\N
2555241	Sheldon	Day	10	73	293	9.625	Day plays stronger than his measurements might indicate. Heady and hustling, he also holds his ground against double teams and may have the best hands of any lineman in the draft. Day played inside and outside for the Irish, regularly making plays in the backfield in 2015 (15.5 tackles for loss, four sacks, 13 quarterback hurries) on his way to USA Today first-team All-American honors. The three-year starter nearly matched his career tackle for loss total (16.5) and exceeded his sack total (3.5) despite being the focus of opposing offenses.	Has experience at defensive end and tackle. Outstanding quickness off snap and is into gaps before you know it. Noticeably quicker than guards attempting to block him when rushing from inside. Rusher with a pre-­snap plan and a quality counter moves if initial rush is thwarted. Uncommon athleticism for a squatty body type. Fluid drops into space on zone blitzes with unheard of ability to mirror and match receivers in zone. Quick hands and wastes no time shedding single blocks. Has arm­-over pet move. Feels down-blocks and fights against them. Works for arm extension and looks to squeeze his gap vs. run. Motor never stops. Lateral quickness could make him a terror in twisting pass ­rush.	Frame is lacking the pure bulk to make a living inside and the length to become a consistent pass rusher off the edge. Might be caught between positions. A good double team will overwhelm him at point of attack. Doesn?t have power to be consistent bull­-rush threat. Attacks in gaps and on the edges and if he doesn?t win there, rush effectiveness drops significantly. Pass rush production was just OK.	Mike Daniels	Appears to be a man without a true position, but good football players find spots on rosters and snaps on the field. Day makes up for his undersized frame with quick hands, impressive lateral movement and effort level that is rarely matched. There will be teams who scratch him off their draft board due to size and scheme concerns, but his ability to rush the passer from the interior will be sought out by others who recognize his potential value.	\N	43	5.54999999999999982	sheldon-day	\N
2555242	Sheldon	Rankins	10	73	299	9.375	In the Cardinals' three-man front, Rankins presents issues for both interior and outside blockers. His only start as a sophomore was in the team's bowl game, but he came on strong as a junior in the team's first year in the ACC (13.5 tackles for loss, eight sacks, two interceptions). ACC coaches elevated him from a third-team all-conference pick to second team this year (13 tackles for loss, six sacks) as he continued to terrorize ballcarriers. Rankins' versatility as a potential starting five-technique or three-technique makes him a fit in any system.	Powerfully built lower half with very good strength. Is extremely compact, but still flexible and very athletic. Everything he does is explosive. Fires into blockers and can jolt and displace them with a combination of leverage and power. Strong base provides excellent balance to battle against double teams or down blocks. At times, will absolutely own finesse blockers. Elite foot quickness for interior defender. Will be difficult to hook or cross­face for NFL offensive linemen because of his lateral quickness. Plays with powerful, violent hands. Can play in 2­-gap or 1-­gap scheme and did just that at Louisville. Plays through the blocker reading and shedding on time to make tackles against the run. Loose, explosive hips that allow him to win edge battles and turn the corner as pass rusher and potentially excel in twist game. Highly productive pass rusher in each of the last two season. Bloodhound with great instincts to diagnose and shut­down screens.	Undersized for full-­time interior position by NFL standards. Flashes quite a bit on tape, but many of his victims lacked the strength that he?ll see from NFL guards. Despite having decent arm length, is hardly long-­levered and could struggle to turn the corner against an NFL redirect block once he gets on a guard?s edge. Average secondary rush when his initial charge is stymied. Scouts believe he could lose some quickness if he tries to bulk up to prepare for rigors of NFL interior play. Some teams are concerned about his lack of overall size which could hurt his stock.	Grady Jarrett	Everything about Rankins game screams winning football player. He has been extremely productive as a bull­rusher and edge rusher and he can hold the point of attack or play in gaps. Rankins is a ball of power with rare foot quickness, a great motor and outstanding feel for his position. With so many teams playing in sub­packages now, I would expect both 4-­3 and 3-­4 teams to consider him for an interior spot despite his shorter stature. Thanks to Rankins' ability to disrupt, I think he has a great shot at getting starter's snaps early on, but don't be shocked to see him fall a little in the draft due to his smaller stature.	"Our area scout really likes him a lot and he's already angling for us to consider him, but he falls outside of the physical parameters of what we want from inside guys. I see him as only a 4­-3 nose for a one­-gap defense and that's the only fit." -- Former Louisville defensive tackle Brandon Dunn	59	6.17999999999999972	sheldon-rankins	\N
2555243	Vernon	Butler	10	76	323	10.75	A big body in the middle of the Bulldogs' defense, Butler proved in his two years as a starter that he has the girth and nimble feet to clog up running lanes. Conference USA coaches rectified their error in not giving Butler all-conference recognition in 2014 (56 tackles, 13.5 tackles for loss) by voting him first-team All-C-USA after his senior year (50 tackles, 10 TFL, three sacks, eight quarterback hurries). NFL teams will not miss the opportunity to add Butler to their interior.	Long-­armed knee-bender who can play the role of low man at the point of attack. Plays with strong hands and good arm extension and can ?peek­a­boo? both gaps as he reads which hole the running back heads for. Impressive stack and shed timing and power. Able to eat up double teams and keep his linebackers clean when asked to. Excellent athleticism. Can make plays all along the line of scrimmage. If blocker doesn?t finish, Butler will work himself back into the play. Able to coordinate hands and feet smoothly and has change of direction and closing burst to become a dominant pass rusher from inside. Can slide from gap to gap as a pass rusher and is a perfect fit for twist-­based defense. Generally attacks gaps with forward lean and ability to corner the edge when he has his man beat. Can stutter-­step into pass rush to disrupt offensive lineman?s timing or generate a speed-­to-­power bull rush that can severely dent a pocket. Gives consistent effort and plays like a lead dog looking to eat.	Build is athletic, but a little bit top heavy. Will play with inconsistent base when his pad level gets too high trying to win through the gaps. Will try to outmuscle his opponent when his initial pass rush gets stuck in neutral, rather than use counter moves. For all of his potential and talent, wasn?t as productive as NFL scouts are used to. Plays with some wasted energy and motion and needs to work more efficiently.	Muhammad Wilkerson	Athletic interior lineman with long arms and outstanding athleticism that allows him to work on offensive linemen with a combination of power and quickness. Butler has a raw but diverse skillset as a pass rusher that should excite NFL evaluators who see the potential of what he can be with more coaching and experience. With his effort and defensive ball awareness, his ceiling appears to be high with a chance to become a high-­level starter for an odd or even front defense.	\N	111	6.15000000000000036	vernon-butler	\N
2555244	Bronson	Kaufusi	9	78	285	9.75	This two-sport athlete experimented on the hardwood in 2012-13 before turning his full attention to the gridiron. The two-time first-team All-Independent pick had 15.5 career sacks entering the 2015 season, and added 11 more in an outstanding senior campaign while making 20 tackles for loss. Kaufusi?s size and athleticism have allowed Cougars coaches (of whom his father, Steve, is one) to play him standing up or hand-down during his career. NFL teams will have to decide where he fits best in their system.	Has an honest father as a coach who has been up front about Bronson?s weaknesses and what he needed to work on. Plays with the motor expected from a coach?s son. Quality hand work and is able to redirect with them. Good back­side presence in running game and charges hard down the line of scrimmage. Comes out of his stance and into his pass rush with good pad level and forward lean. Never quits on plays and will pursue way down the field. Has a long frame that may be able to carry more muscle. Posted productive totals in most categories. Blocked a field goal and punt in 2015.	Too easily caved in and washed down when blocked on angles. Tries to bend but pad level still ends up higher than he would like thanks to his height. Play strength is an area of concern. Thin legs lose their base when he is redirected with power. Tight-­hipped pass rusher that has a prolonged corner turn to the quarterback -- even on wins. Much of sack production came on extended plays or with effort over skill. Unable to generate consistent penetration when slanting into gaps. In 2014, lost weight and attempted to play outside linebacker but experiment was a failure.	Denico Autry	Developing talent who flashes enough on tape to believe that some of his production could translate to the NFL. His lack of mass and functional strength could create consistency issues for him early in his career.	"Everyone has been on him for so long that it's kinda anticlimactic now. Someone will take him higher than they should when he tests out at the combine." -- NFC scouting director	75	5.54999999999999982	bronson-kaufusi	\N
2555245	Charles	Tapper	9	75	271	11.5	Tapper was named first-team All-Big 12 as a sophomore in 2013, but only managed honorable mention accolades last season due to a drop in productivity (nine tackles for loss, 5.5 sacks in 2013; 7.5 and three in 2014.) He bounced back in his last tour of Norman, helping the Sooners compete for a national title with another first-team all-conference effort (50 tackles, 10 for loss, seven sacks). The Sports Illustrated honorable mention All-American has a strong all-around game that the NFL will appreciate.	Good size and build. Has natural power at the point of attack. Shows some ability to battle and fight for his area of grass. Technique is flawed in many areas, but has some traits. If he ever learns to drop pad level, has effective bull-­rush potential. May have the body type to play 3-­4 defensive end or 4­-3 base end. Has some straight-line speed to close out the quarterback in space. Heavy tackler who can thump runners. Showed some positive flashes late in the season of what he might become. Raw with room to develop.	Offsets natural power and strength with terrible pad level too often. Offers minimal value as third down player. Plays with very little dynamic movement as a pass rusher and usually just crashes straight ahead with no real plan. Hand usage needs major work. Doesn?t use hands effectively to control the point of attack or to improve his position as a pass rusher. Needs to play square and control gaps when engaged laterally against the run. Instincts and awareness are way off from where they need to be. Slow to see plays developing and can be even slower to disengage from blocks to make tackles near the line of scrimmage.	Jack Crawford	Based on his 2015 tape, Tapper would be a late round pick at best. Tapper doesn't make enough plays against the run and doesn?t possess the traits to believe he'll be an effective pass rusher as a pro. However, if he can improve his pad level and hand usage, he has enough strength to project into an eventual starter or rotation lineman role.	\N	17	5.41999999999999993	charles-tapper	\N
2555246	Delvon	Simmons	9	77	295	\N	Simmons covered a lot of his country during the recruiting process and his collegiate career. The high school All-American from Pennsylvania signed a letter of intent with North Carolina, but received permission to leave behind Chapel Hill before he played down in order to suit up for Tommy Tuberville at Texas Tech. In Lubbock, he played 10 games as a freshman reserve (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss) and started 13 games as a sophomore (27 tackles, six for loss, two sacks). When Tuberville resigned after the 2012 season, Simmons decided it was time for a change, as well, and signed with USC. He was required to sit out in 2013 as a transfer, and then became a starter for the Trojans as a junior (44 tackles, 2.5 for loss, sack, blocked field goal). His senior year was his best, starting all 14 games and earning second team All-Pac-12 honors with 57 tackles, 10.5 for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles and another blocked kick.	Gives consistent effort with an above average motor. Willing to pursue the play with hustle as it moves down the field. Active with his hands looking to slap initial punch away from his frame. Loves to use arm chop pass to kick off his pass rush rep. Can play through his blocker and locate ball quickly. Shows some stack and shed edge potential along with desired shed timing. Can close down rushing creases with necessary lateral movement down the line.	High­-cut with thick upper body but thin calves. Plays too high and can be knocked off ­balance by redirect blocks. Needs to play with better knee bend to improve his leverage. Base is much too narrow and frequently finds himself on the ground after getting feet tangled in the trash. Dynamic movement is not his thing. Straight-­ahead pass rusher missing twitch to explode upfield off the snap. Raw pass rusher lacking speed­-to-­power talent and an effective counter move.	\N	Rotational defensive end best ­suited to play the run rather than rush the passer. Simmons has the size and potentially strength to play end in a 3­-4, but his arm length is less than what defensive coordinators look for at that position. Simmons probably doesn?t have the base or thickness to play inside on a full-time basis as a pro, so power end in a 4­-3 or 3-­4 five ­technique is his best shot.	\N	50	4.90000000000000036	delvon-simmons	\N
2555247	Jason	Fanaika	9	74	271	9.875	This strong-side defensive end has played for both Utah State and Utah during his career, playing two seasons with the Aggies and then going on a church mission in Indianapolis before moving on to Salt Lake City. Fanaika (fan-NA-ee-ka) has been a high-motor producer for the Utes the past two years, starting eight games (9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks) in 2014 and then honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors as a senior (10.5 tackles for loss, four sacks).	Comes off the snap as low man and is able to work under opponents pads and gain leverage at the point of attack. Has adequate strength in hands and upper body. Better speed in open space than expected. Asked to play with hand up and down on the edge. Has had success rushing passer when bumped inside. Uses arm­-over as pet move as pass rusher from interior spot and can gain quick advantage with it. Holds his own at point of attack. Able to unlock from block and transition into tackle readiness. Tackles with a heavy thud. Finds ways to finish once he gets pass protector on the ropes. Has long arms and is able to press them into extension.	Out of shape and way too heavy in 2015. Play looked fatigued at times and extra weight hurt his quickness as a pass rusher. Slow twitch player with below average change of direction in space. Slow get­ off and is unable to cause stress around the edge as a rusher. Square-­shouldered pass rusher with limited upper body and hip flexion to turn the corner on offensive tackles. Average foot quickness forces him to make lunging tackle attempts in space. Had nine missed and two broken tackle attempts in 2015.	\N	Will be 24 years old when NFL training camps begin and appears to be a player without a go­-to play strength or an obvious NFL position. Fanaika doesn?t have the twitch or overall talent to be a dangerous NFL pass rusher, but he has some power at the point of attack and might be able to make a team looking for a strong base end who can set the edge. Regardless, it may be in his best interest to slim down to where he was in 2014 when he was more disruptive.	\N	80	5.20000000000000018	jason-fanaika	\N
2555248	Jihad	Ward	9	77	297	9.375	Considering that Jihad (pronounced juh-HODD) Ward went from receiver/safety to the defensive line during his time in junior college, the sky's the limit once he really knows what to do with his size and strength. He was an honorable mention All-Big Ten selection by league coaches (51 tackles, 8.5 tackles for loss, three sacks, four fumble recoveries) in his first season with the Illini, playing inside and outside and using his huge wingspan to swallow ball carriers. Ward, who wears jersey number 17 because that was his mother?s age when he was born, didn?t have the same production as a senior (3.5 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks) but still earned honorable mention notice due to his strong play.	Can play both end spots and has bumped down inside to tackle as well. Has room for even more muscle on his frame. Great effort throughout the play and will continue his chase until whistle blows. Length and down­-the­-line quickness give him expanded playmaking range. Urgent closing burst to the ball. Full force tackler with thump behind his pads. Keeps feet moving and active throughout his pass rush. Can become a quality edge-­setter with a little lower pad level. Has some pass rush reps showing ankle flexion to turn corner at 45-degree angle. Won?t let tight ends punk him. Better pick man than twister in tackle/end and end/tackle twists. Traits are there and teams likely to be patient with his development.	Has tools to set a harder edge but isn't there yet. Inconsistent contact balance. Lays on blocks longer than he should. Needs to keep working on controlling the rep with better hand work. Long legs get caught up in trash around the line of scrimmage. Below average at protecting against cut blocks. Instincts very much a work in progress. Could use nasty glass­-eater mentality at point of attack. Doesn?t flash the mean to impose his will. Not a natural counter puncher as pass rusher once initial try is stuffed. Won't always accelerate into contact as pass rusher limiting his power potential.	\N	Above average athleticism for a man his size and he has the effort level that should lead to continued improvement in the areas where he is deficient. Ward is a developmental prospect who has the size to fit as a 4-­3 base end or defensive tackle and as a 3­-4 defensive end. Is he mean enough to play inside though? He might need a position coach to draw that out of him while he continues to develop.	\N	30	5.57000000000000028	jihad-ward	\N
2555249	Joey	Bosa	9	77	269	10.25	Bosa plans to follow in the footsteps of his father and uncle as NFL first-round picks; John Bosa was picked 16th overall by Miami in 1987 coming out of Boston College, while Eric Kumerow was picked in the same spot, again by the Dolphins, the following year. Joey Bosa's own potential as an elite prospect has been clear since arriving in Columbus, as he made his way into the starting lineup 10 times as a true freshman (13.5 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks) to earn honorable mention All-Big Ten honors. As a sophomore, he captured unanimous All-American honors, the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year award (led the conference with 21 tackles for loss, 13.5 sacks) and was named a finalist for three national awards as the nation?s top defender: the Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy, and Ted Hendricks Award. His junior year got off to a slow start, however, as he was suspended for the opener for violating team rules. Statistically, his 2015 season was not as impressive as the year before (16 tackles for loss, five sacks) but Big Ten coaches still named him the conference?s Defensive Lineman of the Year because of his rare combination of strength against the run and consistent presence in the backfield.	Has an NFL-­ready frame. Good muscular definition and flexibility to go along with a confident, competitive attitude. Solid upfield burst off the snap. Has booming power in his hands. Uses arm extension and forward lean as his primary weapon. Generates speed-­to-­power bullrush and plays off of that with a punch and pull technique that pulls tackles off-­balance. Focuses pass rush attack on outside shoulder of tackle using forward lean and aggressive hand play. Active hands can completely wipe out a tackle?s weak outside hand allowing him to cave-­in the edge. Usually gets hands on defender first. Able to stack and slide along line of scrimmage in pursuit of ball­-carrier. Strong core and able to rag­ doll tight ends who aren?t committed to the fight. Adequate closing burst to the ball. Looks fluid and nimble when dropping into space. Has the talent and traits to be used more aggressively than he was at Ohio State. Grew as a run defender this season. Has forced five fumbles over the last two years. Football is in his blood with a father who was drafted by Dolphins in first round of 1987 draft and an uncle who played at Ohio State in the mid­-80s. Motor will never be a problem.	Too contact-­oriented in his rush and needs to learn to leverage himself around the edge. Forward lean can cause him to go flying when defenders give him a shove. Tape shows surprising lack of play strength when he?s attacked on his edge. Struggles to fight back when being washed down by down blocks. Will end up on the ground more times than expected during game. Instincts a work in progress. Can be slow to process what he sees and can be frozen by zone-­read looks. Not much bang behind his pads as a tackler. Big runners squeeze out additional yards after contact against him. Will vacate his run fit with constant attempts to get over the top of block rather than reading and reacting to both gaps. Not as twitchy and sudden as expected. Feet are a little heavy and it takes just a second to accelerate up to speed after quick direction changes. More attention by offenses brought much fewer sacks. Flagged for offsides 10 times over last two years and 14 penalties total.	Ryan Kerrigan	Body beautiful college end who has the talent and upside to play with a hand down or standing in the pros. Bosa might not have the pure edge speed to be an elite pass rusher, but his hand usage and ability to generate push as a bull-rusher should make him a very good 4-3 base end or a 3-­4 outside linebacker. Bosa has a few more flaws than some may be willing to admit and his upside might be good rather than great, but his traits and growth potential as a player make him a safe selection. Bosa might be at his best with a defensive coordinator willing to move him around the field.	\N	37	6.71999999999999975	joey-bosa	\N
2555250	Josh	Dawson	9	75	265	\N	This high school All-American and Georgia Class AAA All-State pick only cracked the Bulldogs' starting lineup five times in his four years on campus. Dawson played in 51 games in his career, giving effort when given the opportunity to get on the field. His most productive season was 2014, when he started four games, making 17 tackles, four for losses, and a sack in addition to running a fumble back for what proved to be the game-winning touchdown against Tennessee. The previous two years, Dawson totaled 13 tackles, 2.5 for loss in 25 games (one start). And in his final season in Athens, Dawson was again reserve, being credited with eight tackles in 13 games.	When playing on the edge, will find ball­ carrier quickly and rush down the line to close out the running lane. Keeps his hands moving and is active throughout the rep. Wrap­-up tackler.	Lacks any bankable, explosive traits or play qualities. Gets no pressure upfield against the pass and seems to have no real plan. Production level when he's on the field is below average. Undersized for the interior. Doesn't play with necessary arm extension at point of attack and doesn't own his space with authority very often. Never effective enough to play more than 20 percent of the defensive snaps in any of his four seasons.	\N	Came to Georgia as a four-­star recruit, but failed to crack the lineup as a full­-time starter during his time in school. Dawson doesn't have the size or NFL-­level athleticism to fit into any particular position on the NFL level and even a camp invite could be a long ­shot.	\N	83	4.59999999999999964	josh-dawson	\N
2555251	Ronald	Blair	9	74	284	10.25	Blair was a second-team all-state pick in Georgia, but ended up at App. State instead of the SEC -? to the chagrin of the Mountaineers? opponents. In his first three full years on the field (he missed most of 2013 with a thumb injury), he?s been an all-conference pick (two years in the FCS-level Southern Conference, 2014 in the Sun Belt) racking up 33 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks. Blair finished his career by winning the Sun Belt Conference?s Defensive Player of the Year (70 tackles, 19 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks), lining up outside and inside to take advantage of presented mismatches.	Flashes some polish in his game. Comes out of track stance and fires into blockers with knee bend and good pad level. Uses leverage and tremendous power at the point of attack to rock offensive linemen who let their pads get too high. Able to set a strong edge. Attacks and stresses the seam of double team blocks with power in his legs. His coaches rave about his leadership and work in the film room. Good lateral quickness with his feet and is very effective as a pass rusher in twists up front. Accelerates down the line to squeeze cutback lanes against the run. Bodies up and drives his legs through his tackles making sure running backs feel it. Has effective arm-­over as his go-­to move. Good length with big hands for his size. Can generate a quality bull rush.	Shorter than teams would like at the defensive end spot. Lacks the overall agility and athleticism to play standing up. Carries some bad weight around the midsection. Could improve his overall conditioning. Very little edge presence as a pass rusher. Unlikely to become a one­-on-­one winner as a pass rusher on the next level. Despite playing with knee bend out of snap, allows his pads level to get too high at times and can be knocked off balance as pass rusher.	\N	Highly decorated four­-year starter who capped off a successful career by being named Sun Belt Defensive Player of the Year in 2015. He doesn?t have the ability as a pass rusher to excite NFL teams, but his strength at the point of attack and quality tape against Clemson this past season should not be discounted. Blair is an undersized, rotational base ­end in a 4­-3 who might be able to add extra weight and get a look inside as a three-­technique thanks to his toughness and strength.	\N	130	5.53000000000000025	ronald-blair	\N
2555252	Shaq	Lawson	9	75	269	\N	Great things were expected from Lawson, who was the top-rated prep school player in the country out of Hargrave Military Academy after a successful high school career in South Carolina. He played well as a reserve for two seasons behind the ever-stacked Tiger defensive line, racking up double-digit tackles for loss each year (10 in 2013, 11 in 2014). With the departure of the likes of Vic Beasley and Malliciah Goodman, Lawson finally got a chance to start in 2015 and made the most of it, constantly exploding into the backfield to finish among the nation's leaders in tackles for loss (25.5) and sacks (12.5). Lawson's personal accomplishments (consensus All-American, first-team All-ACC) led to great team success, as he and fellow junior Kevin Dodd and sophomore Heisman Trophy candidate Deshaun Watson helped the Tigers to an undefeated regular season, ACC title, and national championship game appearance.	Built like a tank with thickly muscled legs and a broad chest. Clemson played him at 5-­technique and standing up on the outside. Scheme versatile and will likely appeal to be 3­-4 and 4-­3 teams. Very powerful at the point of attack. Able to punch, extend arms and control the line of scrimmage or set a hard edge. Able to shock and shed blockers and has the hand quickness to staggered block attempts. Power allows him to play on other side of the line. Finished second in the nation in "stuffs" for defensive linemen with 17. Comes off ball low and with forward lean into his rush. Has frame to handle a double team. Has plus instincts and feel for the game. Toughness in full display.	Thickly bound with very average flexibility. Average athlete for an end position. Not a natural hip bender and will have to focus on keeping pad level lower to unlock his leverage potential. Shows obvious signs of fatigue as game wears on. At times, is too content to lean on blocks when play isn?t run to his side rather than working to discard. Will have snaps where he seems more concerned with imposing his will on blocking rather than diagnosing the play. Doesn?t have the bend or upper body flexion to be edge turner as pass rusher. Effort sacks will diminish in pros and will need to become more nuanced pass rusher.	Courtney Upshaw	Productive backup for two years before putting together an All­-American season in his first year as a full- time starter. Lawson is built like a full­-grown man and combines his instincts, toughness and power to fill up a stat sheet and set an early tone. Lawson's frame and game are easily translatable to the NFL, but his average athleticism and pass rush skills will likely have teams viewing him as a 3­-4 edge setter or a 4-­3 base end. Lawson may also have value as 3­-4 defensive tackle in an upfield scheme.	"I see Shaq as an outside linebacker in a 3-4. He's not the guy you want to turn loose against the quarterback, but he is the guy that will make it hard for tight ends to block him in the run game. We knew we couldn?t run at him and it changed how we called plays." -- ACC offensive coach	1	6.26999999999999957	shaq-lawson	\N
2555292	Scooby	Wright III	12	72	239	9.75	Philip "Scooby" Wright III (his dad gave him the nickname, calling him his "little Scooby-Doo") was simply the best defender in college football in 2014, winning the coveted triple crown of national awards: the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, Rotary Lombardi Award and Chuck Bednarik Award. The unanimous All-American and Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year ranked among the top five players in the country with 163 tackles, 29 tackles for loss, 14 sacks and six forced fumbles. He was a one-man wrecking crew. Wright showed some glimpses of that talent in his freshman season, where he started 12 games, making 83 tackles, 9.5 for loss, and an interception straight off the bus as a two-time California All-State pick. His junior year was much more of a struggle than he expected, as he played just three games due first to a torn lateral meniscus in this left knee and then to a sprained right foot. His final game in a Wildcat uniform was one to remember, however, as he racked up 15 stops, 3.5 for loss and two sacks against an option team in the New Mexico Lobos in the New Mexico Bowl. Wright was a two-star recruit despite his successful high school career due to a perceived lack of athleticism, but doubters of his ability to play in the NFL have hopefully learned their lesson.	Possesses elite instincts. Appears to head in direction of the play like he knows the play call. Extremely active and always on the balls of his feet and ready to hunt. Plays with an insane amount of competitive fire. Flows quickly to point with downhill action and looking to disrupt. Is often able to force cutbacks or alter the running back?s track. Can time snaps and shoot gaps making him a dangerous blitzer. His 2014 season, which included 163 tackles, 29 tackles for losses, 14 sacks and six forced fumbles, is widely considered the most productive for a linebacker in college football history. Explodes with hips into tackles and finishes with his feet. Play speed is faster than timed speed thanks to combination of instincts and burst to the ball. Shows plus lateral agility with ability to engage in, shed, or beat the block.	Needs to learn to harness his energy and passion to improve his body control. Will end up on the ground a little too often due to revved up motor. Average athlete with below average straight­-line speed. Plays upright. Needs more bend in his waist and knees to improve his pad level and leverage. Can improve his tackling. Will get run through at times due to leverage issues. Stiff change of direction creates arm tackling situations and missed tackles. Gets caught guessing sometimes and will vacate his run fit.	Zach Thomas	Scooby Wright probably won?t tear up the combine with eye-popping athletic numbers and his injury-plagued 2015 season put his name on the back­burner as far as draft discussions, but his instincts, production and overall competitive fire make him one of the safer second day bets in this draft. He could make a late move up the draft board for teams who value elite production.	"I hope he falls to us because I will do everything in my power to get him drafted. Make Zach Thomas your comp for him. They are the exact same guy." -- AFC East area scout	46	6.01999999999999957	scooby-wright iii	\N
2555253	Ugonna	Awuruonye	9	76	252	\N	Was a redshirt at Towson State in 2011-­2012 and transferred to Campbell the following season. In 2013, named honorable mention All­-PFL totaling seven sacks and 14 tackles for loss. Finished 2014 with 7.5 sacks and 14.5 tackles for loss on the way to becoming a first-team All­-Conference selection. Played under head coach Mike Minter, who was a 10-­year NFL safety.	Features superior length and upper body strength to dispatch inferior competition at the tackle position. Good muscle thickness in his lower half. Able to stack and shed without overexerting himself and can close out running backs darting through his neighborhood with a heavy thud as a tackler. Once he?s on a blocker?s edge, he sees through the challenger to the quarterback and is usually able to win the edge with play strength.	Doesn?t have quick-­twitch explosiveness to maximize his length and strength. Slow upfield burst as a pass rusher with hip tightness. First three steps upfield are not threatening to tackles with average foot quickness. Plays with high pads and heavy feet creating issues with ability to change direction. Not the most urgent backside chaser out there. Play­making radius limited by his straight line play traits. Bull rusher in need of more skilled hand usage.	\N	Looks the part on the hoof, but all of his length and upper body strength can?t save him from his plodding feet that limit him as a pass rusher. While Awuruonye can land a heavy blow and has decent strength to handle his responsibilities as a run­ stopper, his lack of athleticism makes him too much of a small area defender.	\N	6926	4.79999999999999982	ugonna-awuruonye	\N
2555254	Dadi	Nicolas	9	75	235	10.375	In a world where pass rushers are coveted more than umbrellas in New York during a rainstorm, Nicolas has the smooth acceleration off the line to make it in the NFL. The Haitian-born, 2014 second-team All-ACC pick (18.5 tackles for loss, nine sacks) is misused as a base end in the Hokies' defense, which resulted in a drop in production in 2015 (seven tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks, honorable mention honors), though he's likely to transition to linebacker at the next level for one of the many teams relying on 3-4 alignments as their base defense. Nicolas only started playing football his senior year of high school, so NFL coaches can still help him hone his skills.	Has lightning quick inside moves,­ including spin,­ that can catch slow­-footed tackles sleeping. Long-strider with the acceleration and lateral quickness to create problems when twisting inside. Plays with desired upfield burst. As pass rusher, can brush aside lazy outside hand placement to open door around the edge. Forced two fumbles and recovered two more in 2015. Miscast with hand in the ground and over-matched physically, but was always willing to compete and battle the man across from him. Has experience as outside linebacker. Bouncy athleticism in space and looks natural dropping into space. Good burst to make up ground quickly while chasing the ball. Runs through tackles with as much force as he can muster with his size.	Looks more like a safety than an edge player. Two years of tape show alarming lack of functional strength. Easily redirected as pass rusher and washed down against the run. Not a physical player by nature. Labors to disengage. Can be controlled by by quality tight ends at the point of attack. Avoids contact at times to stay clean rather than stacking and shedding. Edge-­setting always an issue as an end or outside linebacker. Below average instincts against the run. Thin lower body foreshadows inability to generate speed to power. Needs to eliminate false step from his get­ off. Below average body control in space overrunning plays that are there to be made.	\N	Wiry edge player forced to play too often with a hand in the ground despite his clear lack of power to handle the the position. Nicolas combines hustle and exciting athletic traits that will have evaluators trying to find a place for him, but without better technique and overall strength, life as an edge player might be difficult. If a team is willing to be patient, it might be worth taking a look at Nicolas as a 3-­4 inside linebacker.	\N	28	5.28000000000000025	dadi-nicolas	\N
2555255	De'Vondre	Campbell	13	76	232	9.625	Wiry and strong, Campbell is just scratching the surface of his potential. Though you'd expect a linebacker of that size to be purely a pass rusher, the Hutchinson Community College transfer moves better than expected in the open field. After a solid sophomore (three starts in 13 games played, 41 tackles, three for loss) season for the Gophers, he earned a starting role as a junior (75 tackles, 6.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks). Campbell lived up to his billing in 2015, named by Big Ten coaches and media honorable mention all-conference as he made 92 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and a team-high four sacks.	NFL­-caliber athleticism. Looks the part on the hoof with thickness through bubble and thighs with tapered calves. Has the quick­-twitch to respond suddenly and explode towards the ball. Possesses quality chase speed to close down running backs looking to turn the corner, but runs under control. Uses length for expanded tackle radius. Plays with ready hands and often strikes first blow against blockers while looking to shed. Has played in the middle and outside. Looks like he has some edge-­setting qualities. Uses arm over move effectively as blitzer. Flashes some pop behind his pads and has the combination of speed and length to restrict backside cut­back lanes.	Linebacker instincts missing badly. Too many snaps where he does the offensive lineman?s job for him by running himself out of position and becoming an easily blockable target. Is slow to diagnose what is happening and is consistently behind on the play relying on athleticism too often. Needs technique work and additional coaching. Doesn?t keep pads square consistently when scraping down the line. Sits and waits on the second level rather than using natural burst to play downhill. Below average at leveraging his run fits. When dropping into coverage, looks like he?s occupying space rather than looking to squeeze top or routes. Needs to read quarterback?s eyes more and drift into passing windows.	\N	Campbell has an Academic All-­Big Ten under his belt, but the classroom smarts don?t always translate into on­field instincts for the linebacker. While Campbell has terrific size and NFL-­caliber athleticism, his inability to consistently perform his assignments as a second level linebacker could make him a project.	\N	35	5.29000000000000004	devondre-campbell	\N
2555256	Jordan	Jenkins	13	75	259	11.25	Jenkins, Georgia's Most Improved Player for the 2014 season (9.5 tackles for loss, five sacks), came out in a flash as a senior, racking up 11 tackles, 5.5 for loss and two sacks against Vanderbilt. Groin and hip injuries limited him throughout the year, however (59 tackles, 10.5 for loss, four sacks), keeping him off all-conference teams. Jenkins started six games as a true freshman(eight tackles for loss, five sacks) and earned second-team All-SEC honors as a sophomore (12 tackles for loss, five sacks) before truly coming into his own as a junior.	Very aware of what is happening around him. Has a high football IQ and has understanding of down, distance and tendencies. Physical at the point of attack and sets a strong edge. Has desired thickness and play strength to hold up against NFL edge blockers and freakishly long arms and big hands for his size. Won?t sit on blocks and uses powerful hands to shed and get into the action. Has played standing and with a hand in the dirt and can handle himself in zone coverage. Team captain. Brings a pro-­ready play demeanor to the field each Saturday.	Not a dynamic pass rusher. Has some knee stiffness in his rush and won?t ?out-­athlete? many NFL tackles. Upright play limits his speed-­to-­power effectiveness as a bull-­rusher. Average upfield explosion off the snap. Did not impress against Alabama. Dealt with a nagging groin injury this season.	Nick Perry	Three-year starter who has played both outside linebacker spots in the Bulldogs 3-­4 defense. With Jenkins length and outstanding power on the edge, he is a natural fit as an edge-­setting strongside 3­-4 outside linebacker in the pros. Jenkins may not be viewed as dangerous enough as a pass rusher to warrant a first round pick, but he?s a safe pick whose toughness and football IQ make him an early starter candidate.	"I think he's a plug-and-play second-rounder who can play in an odd or even front.

The native of Nigeria started school earlier than most, moving to Charlotte, North Carolina as a 10-year-old sixth grader -- and he just kept growing, mentally and physically. Despite turned 17 just before his freshman year, he played all 13 games as a reserve linebacker (seven tackles). Okwara started one game as a sophomore, playing in all 13 contests at linebacker and making 19 tackles, 1.5 for loss. After moving to defensive end (though he stood up at times) for the last two seasons, Romeo failed to show love to opposing quarterbacks as a 25-game starter, leading the Irish in sacks in 2014 (four, 39 tackles) and 2015 (right, 48 tackles, 12.5 for loss).	Mindful of contain responsibilities and fights against being hooked on run plays to perimeter. Good arm length with big hands. Has natural upper body strength with decent power in his hands.	Pad level is sky high and loses leverage almost immediately. Extremely raw. Slow reaction time off the snap and doesn?t have the twitch to burst upfield and threaten an edge as a rusher. Stiff and struggles with direction change. Lacks instincts and pass rush talent.	\N	Big edge player who looks great on the hoof, but who is extremely stiff and mechanical in his movements. Okwara is missing the quickness to be an NFL pass rusher while being a block magnet in the running game. Unless he finds a way to unleash his natural power and have it translate to production on the field, making a roster will be exceptionally difficult.	\N	43	4.79999999999999982	romeo-okwara	\N
2555258	Theiren	Cockran	9	76	252	\N	This tall, lean defensive end split his time between football and basketball until late in his high school career. His coach, Bobby McCray, recognized his potential since Cockran had the same build as his son, Bobby, who played defensive end at Florida and in the NFL. Since Cockran's focused primarily on football, he has been a thorn in the side of offensive lines both in high school and the Big Ten. The Gophers? reach into Florida (Miami Homestead) well worth the effort, as Cockran was an honorable mention All-Big Ten pick after a senior season where he made 28 tackles, seven for loss, and three sacks. He had similar statistics as a starter in 2013 (30 tackles, 10 TFL, team-leading seven sacks)and 2014 (23 tackles, seven TFL, four sacks).	Has rushed the passer with a hand in the ground and standing up. Has relatively long arms for his size. Shows more upfield burst as a pass rusher standing than with a hand in the ground. Uses a chop combined with inside spin move as his most effective rush move.	Lacking in body control and necessary quickness. Gets knocked off course too easily -- even by tight ends at times -- during his pass rush. Hip tightness for days. Needs to play with better bend for leverage setting the edge. Below average change of direction quickness and is slow to accelerate down the line and close down running lanes. Below average upfield burst as pass rusher.	\N	High-character leader for the Gophers with a consistent work ethic according to scouts. Cockran has put on necessary mass during his time at Minnesota, but it has cost him some quickness. His lack of athleticism and overall pass-rushing talent make finding a spot for him in this draft a challenge.	\N	35	4.65000000000000036	theiren-cockran	\N
2555259	Carson	Wentz	1	77	237	\N	In his first year as a starter for the Bison in 2014, all Wentz did was throw for 3,111 yards and 25 touchdowns, leading the team to its fourth consecutive FCS Championship. What did the Bismarck, N.D. native do for an encore? Just come back from a broken right wrist that sidelined him for two months to lead NDSU in a fifth-straight title game victory. He started seven games in his senior year, completing 62.5 percent of his passes for 1,651 yards and 17 touchdowns (and four interceptions) while also running for six scores. Intelligence and work ethic are no issues for Wentz, who was named to the College Sports Information Directors Association All-American squad for the second-straight year.	Tall with an athletic, proportional build that is made for the NFL position. Played in a pro-­style attack with plenty of snaps under center. Asked to make NFL throws and showed he could do it. Stands tall in the pocket and delivers with a relatively high release point. Keeps ball high and tight in the pocket and can uncork it quickly with tight, sharp release and little wasted motion. Throws catchable ball with tight spiral. Naturally accurate passer. Sees lurking linebackers underneath and throws receivers open to safest spot in the passing window. Able to change arm slots and still throw a strike. Has plus deep ball accuracy and touch. Calm in pocket and has no problems sitting in and taking a hit to complete a pass. Excelled in structured passing attack that required him to read the entire field. Has athleticism to escape pressure and hurt defenses with his legs. Already able to feel pressure on the edges and slide around in pocket without dropping his eyes. Adept in play-­action game at selling fakes and quickly finding safeties to help determine where to go with the ball. Intelligent with long list of academic achievements. Should be able to process and handle an NFL playbook quickly. Can play pitch and catch all day long against zone coverage.	When rolling out, will float it a little too much when taking shots down the field. Allows passing windows to close quickly when he short­ arms his release. Needs a little more consistency on anticipatory throws outside the hash. Will get caught locking in on target bringing secondary charging in to make a play on the ball. Inconsistent footwork from the pocket. Arm gets ahead of his feet even with time to come to balance. Needs to pick up pace of his post-­snap setup. Has to put a little extra air on his field-­side throws. Can be a little flat with his downfield, touch throws. Has to eliminate the occasional nonchalant throw into tight quarters. Doesn't look comfortable yet with bootleg rollouts to the left. Broke a bone in his throwing wrist in October sidelining him for eight weeks. Dealt with arm and shoulder injuries as a baseball player in high school. Lower level of competition could cause issues for him adapting to NFL speed.	Blake Bortles	With a body type that is as prototypical as they come and a background in reading the entire field and working through progressions, Wentz will immediately check a couple of boxes that many college quarterbacks won't be able to check. While his arm strength is OK, he can still make all the throws and he can make them with accuracy. His ability to escape pressure and pick up first downs with his feet will be yet another check mark in his favor. Wentz is still in a developmental phase after just two years at an FBS program, but has the mental and physical building blocks of a future, franchise quarterback.	\N	317	6.50999999999999979	carson-wentz	\N
2555260	Dak	Prescott	1	74	226	10.875	Rayne Dakota "Dak" Prescott proved himself to be an excellent college quarterback in 2014, breaking all sorts of school records (4,435 yards of total offense, 27 touchdown passes, 61.6 completion percentage), named a finalist for the Maxwell, Davey O'Brien, Manning, and Unitas Golden Arm awards and helping his team to a 10-3 record. The two-time first team All-SEC pick ended up with 38 MSU records after a senior year where he won the Senior CLASS Award as the top scholar-athlete on and off the field. Prescott led the team in passing (3,793 yards, 66.2 completion percentage, 29 TD, five INT) and rushing (588 yards, 10 scores) for the second straight year in 2015, joining Tim Tebow as the only two players in SEC history to accomplish that feat. Prescott got on the radar as a redshirt freshman in 2012, playing as a red-zone quarterback, scoring four times as a passer and four as a runner. The next year, he started seven games in two-quarterback system (Tyler Russell), throwing with 1,940 yards, and 10 touchdowns (seven INT), missing two games with an elbow injury.	Thick, muscular frame. Has proven over last three seasons that he can withstand a pounding. Has enough natural arm strength and hip snap to fit throws into an NFL window. Stands tall and delivers a tight spiral with over-­the­-top delivery. Very little wind­up and gets ball out with the flick of a wrist. When pocket is clean, can deliver accurate strikes around the field. Played with improved vision and care for football this season and eliminated many of the ill-­fated throws that turned into interceptions in 2014. Still a work in progress, but continues to show a level of growth as a passer. Threat with his legs, scoring 37 rushing touchdowns over last three seasons and had 94 rushes of ten yards or more during that time. Can be used as goal-­line rushing option. Willing to extend plays outside of pocket with legs but look to finish the play with his arm. Mentally tough enough to carry a heavy offensive burden for the Bulldogs over last three years. When protected better in 2014, showed an ability to challenge deep and strike with accuracy and touch.	Beat up this year thanks to poor protection. When he wasn't being sacked, he was being hit hard. Not as competitive a rusher in 2015. Sacks and usage in run game might be taking a toll. Increase in short pass attempts from 86 to 208 this year reason for higher completion numbers. Accuracy on intermediate and deep throws dropped sharply. Pocket poise has been compromised. Hyper­ aware of pressure around him and lacks awareness to slide and find temporary shelter to make throw. Concern over pressure too often trumps ability to get through progressions. Must speed up the pace of his reads. Footwork is a mess. Slight stride onto stiff upper leg with little weight shift. Restricted follow through and too often tries to muscle throws with upper body. Throws to target rather than leading or throwing them open on short/intermediate throws. Too respectful of underneath coverage and must be more willing to challenge the defense. Needs to improve anticipation.	Brett Hundley	Hard to find an NFL comp for Prescott because he's built like Donovan McNabb, but lacks McNabb's ability and polish. Prescott has NFL size, mobility and enough arm, but the tape shows a player who must improve his mechanics, poise and quickness through his progressions if he is to become a full­-time starter in the NFL. There are absolutely draftable traits and upside, but he will need extended work to smooth out his flaws. Until then, a team would be wise to utilize him on short-yardage packages.	\N	92	5.41999999999999993	dak-prescott	\N
2555261	Jacoby	Brissett	1	76	231	9.75	Brissett's build (6-foot-4, 235), strong arm, and ability to pick up first downs with his feet will intrigue teams looking for a potential starter in a draft lacking great talent at the position. Brissett started his career at Florida, but transferred to N.C. State due to a recruiting relationship with head coach Dave Doeren. He?s started every game the past two years, shining against Florida State (32-for-48, 359 yards, three touchdowns) in 2014, which portended a nice senior year that saw him earn honorable mention All-ACC honors (2,662 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, six interceptions).	Big quarterback with an NFL arm. Has the frame and lower body strength to shake off a would­-be sack and extend the play. Possesses competitive spirit and football character needed to be an NFL quarterback. Has a fastball and changeup. Able to step and drive ball into tight windows with plus accuracy or put feathery soft touch on throws when needed. Plays in pro­-style scheme. Has experience under center and is comfortable in boot-­action pass attack. Makes good decisions reading combination routes. Generally accurate passer who excels in intermediate throws. Wolfpack offense features a menu full of challenging deep outs and field side throws, but he has the arm, timing and confidence to handle it. Makes anticipatory throws into developing windows without flinching. Able to bolt pocket and challenge defenses with his feet. Ran less in 2015, choosing to challenge defenses with his arm after extending plays outside the pocket. Has arm talent, strength and moxie to make winning plays with defenders draped on him and completed almost 60 percent of his passes when forced to throw on the move. Rose to the occasion against Florida State in 2014 and Clemson in 2015.	Downward trajectory from over­-the­-top delivery causes some throws to sink. Has been severely pressured over last two seasons and developed bad habits because of it. Will drop eyes when he feels pressure and throws off his back foot as tools of survival. Occasionally muscles a back­foot throw despite having time to step and drive the ball. Still learning to calm feet and deliver rather than bail when defender is closing in. Carries ball low and away from body when scrambling. Has moments where he is oblivious to pre­-snap tells that blitz is coming off the edge. Needs to transition from always trying to fight through sacks to getting rid of the ball more quickly. Struggles with deep ball accuracy completing just 23.1 percent on attempts of 21-plus yards. Had several overthrows when tasked with deep throws down sideline versus man coverage. Failed to recognize receivers running wide open down the seam. Gets locked in on a pre­-snap plan and has issues altering his itinerary quickly.	Brett Hundley	With his size, arm and competitiveness, there are times when Brissett will remind you of Jameis Winston, but Winston understood the nuances of the position early in his college career while Brissett is still learning. Brissett?s overall ability as a passer is NFL-­caliber and he should continue to show rapid improvement on the next level with better weapons and protection. While an NFL staff will need to help him overcome his bad habits and learn to be more consistent with his pre­-snap recognitions, Brissett has the tools to become an NFL starter.	\N	6	5.5	jacoby-brissett	\N
2555262	Jeff	Driskel	1	76	234	9.75	Driskel was supposed to be the "next Tim Tebow" at Florida, a Maxwell Club High School Player of the Year who presents a dual threat with his arm and feet. He started for the Gators as a sophomore, winning 10 games with good statistics (63.7 completion percentage, 12 touchdowns versus five interceptions, 408 rush yards). His third and fourth years in Gainesville weren?t what he desired, however, as he took a medical redshirt in 2013 due to a broken leg and then was relegated to a part-time starter the following year. Driskel finished his career on a high note as a graduate transfer at Louisiana Tech, earning Conference USA Newcomer of the Year and honorable mention all-conference recognition (4,033 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, seven interceptions).	Prototypical build and athleticism. Quick­-footed signal-caller with rapid setup in the pocket. Has active, bouncy feet while turning and scanning from target to target. Possesses arm strength and pace on his throws to challenge play­making cornerbacks in man and instinctive linebackers in zone. Can get ball out quickly with the flick off his wrist. Fundamentally sound with good footwork to balance himself before driving the ball with good weight transfer and hip rotation. Dangerous runner outside the pocket and can escape with suddenness. Good open-­field speed and ability to operate in zone-­read packages. Willing to throw the ball away and move to next play rather than take unnecessary sacks. Accurate and confident in short passing game.	Struggles to lead receivers with throws, forcing them to break stride or adjust to throws behind them limiting their yards after catch. Short arms passes when throwing on the move causing issues with under-thrown balls. Accuracy drops substantially on throws down the field, with overthrows robbing him of big plays despite receivers having a step on cornerbacks over the top. Anxious when pocket gets turbulent and will occasionally feel pressure that isn?t there.	Drew Stanton	Driskel still has the size, arm strength and athleticism that made him the top-­rated quarterback coming out of high school, but he hasn?t experienced enough growth at the position due to his rocky path to the draft. A positive 2015 helped Driskell regain some confidence, but he?s not where he needs to be yet. With his upside and traits, Driskel is worthy of a day three selection and could yield dividends with patience and coaching.	\N	111	5.12999999999999989	jeff-driskel	\N
2555263	Kevin	Hogan	1	75	218	10.25	Following Andrew Luck is not a fate I'd wish on anyone. Hogan's handled it very well, battling through inconsistency before leading the Cardinal to a Pac-12 title as a senior. He was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 and Pac-12 Championship Game MVP in his redshirt freshman year, but failed to earn any accolades in 2013 even though his team won the Pac-12 championship. Hogan?s numbers were actually pretty good in 2014 (65.9 percent, 2,792 yards, 19 touchdowns, eight interceptions), but the team had a disappointing 8-5 season, leading some to question his ability as a leader. However, he came back strong in 2015, improving his accuracy (67.8 completion percentage) while passing for 2,867 yards and 27 touchdowns to garner second-team All-Pac-12 honors and finishing as a finalist for the Manning Award as the nation's top quarterback. Hogan certainly looks the part (6-foot-4, 218), has football genes in his family (close relatives played at Navy, Arizona, and Notre Dame), has won a lot of games (36-10 as a starter), and possesses the athleticism to be effective running the zone read (85 carries, 336 yards, six touchdowns in 2015) at that size.	Consistent winner and tough. Scouts say his teammates and coaches see through deficiencies and trust the competitiveness above all else. Has NFL size. Benefited from playing in a pro­-style attack. Has adequate mobility and is unafraid to pull the ball down and get tough yards to extend drives. Extremely bright person. Doesn't always look pretty, but finds ways to make winning plays in adverse situations. Doesn't get cute and feeds his top talent. Tasked to manage the offense and did just that. Smart and self­-aware. Understands his strengths and weaknesses and doesn?t take very many low percentage chances. Was the most accurate short-yardage passer in Pac-12 at 76.7 percent.	Mechanics and footwork are a mess. Throws with a very wide base, a pitcher's stride and a protracted delivery. Ball rarely comes out of his hands cleanly. Plays flat­-footed in the pocket with little bounce as he scans field and does a poor job of re­setting and coming to balance before delivery. Below-average arm strength and struggles to consistently make accurate, catchable throws to the field side. Average at reading defenses, preventing him from getting ball out on time. Needs much more poise and pocket awareness. Had issues climbing and sliding to clean areas of the pocket when they were there. Drops eyes and immediately panics when pressure is mounting in his face. Took sacks he had no business taking. Lacking desired touch and accuracy on his deep throws.	\N	Hogan has the size, mobility and quarterback's demeanor that could interest a team on the third day of the draft. He doesn?t have the arm that many teams look for and his intermediate and deep accuracy still need work. Hogan will need time and coaching to try and improve his mechanics and footwork if he wants to have a shot to be an NFL backup.

2555264	Liam	Nadler	1	77	232	\N	In high school was named to the All­-District and All­-Conference first teams in football and was a four-year basketball letterman. Redshirted in 2011. Four-year starter at Gannon. Threw for 21 touchdowns as a redshirt freshman in 2012. Started in every game in 2013 totaling 30 rushing/passing touchdowns while earning second-­team All­-Conference honors. In 2014, had a rushing and passing touchdown in five games and led the conference in total yards per contest.	Has desired size of an NFL pocket passer. Will stand tall in the pocket and stand in against pressure when needed. Productive four-year starter who is lauded for his leadership and character on and off the field. Highly intelligent and willing to go back to teammates who burned him with drops. Doesn?t show much heat on his throws, but issue looks to be with a lack of lower body involvement which is coachable.	Not a natural passer. Throws are wobbly out of his hands. Has habit of failing to throw on time, crowding receivers against the sideline on outs. Accuracy downfield can be very hit or miss. Has a three-­quarter delivery and a dip pre­-delivery. Takes awhile to get the ball out of his hands even on hitches and bubble screens. Doesn?t appear to have the accuracy or zip to make NFL throws.	\N	Four-year starter who had solid production against lower level of competition, but was a product of the scheme. Doesn?t have an NFL arm to go along with his NFL­-caliber size. Possesses leadership qualities scouts like, but likely not enough traits to get much of a look on the next level.	\N	1019	4.75999999999999979	liam-nadler	\N
2555265	A'Shawn	Robinson	10	76	307	10.5	Nick Saban has made a habit of creating NFL defensive lineman during his time in Tuscaloosa, recruiting the best of the best from the high school ranks and making the most of their potential. Robinson was another one of those five-star recruits who came in ready to contribute. He played all 13 games (starting two) as a true freshman, making 38 stops, eight for loss, and leading the Tide with 5.5 sacks. Robinson displayed versatility by playing inside and outside as a sophomore, earning honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media as a full-time starter (6.5 tackles for loss) by splitting his time between the nose tackle and five-technique spots. He first gained the true attention of scouts that season when racking up nine tackles, three for loss, against Missouri in the SEC Championship Game. Robinson's career reached its apex in 2015, as he garnered consensus All-American honors and was named a finalist for the Outland Trophy. He was one of the main cogs of the nation?s third-rated defense, making 46 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks in 15 games as the Tide won the national title.	Body beautiful for an interior lineman. Well-­proportioned with powerful, tree­ trunk legs make it tough to move him off the spot. Has boom in his punch and dislodges guards and centers if they try and wait on him. Pure power to toss a one-­on-­one block aside. Athletic enough to give reasonable chase to the ball. Well schooled in using length to stuff cut blocks. Has frame and length to eat blocks and allow linebackers to run free. Heavy tackler. Running backs do not break his tackles and he rarely fails to finish when he?s locked in on his target. Able to generate pocket push when he gets it cranked up as a pass rusher. Boss man in the locker room and in practice helping to hold teammates accountable. Coming into the draft with relatively fresh legs playing just 57 percent of Alabama?s defensive snaps over last two seasons. Has brute force to match NFL power immediately.	Pad level is his arch enemy. Plays too upright when asked to move. Looks to have flexibility to drop his pads, but doesn?t do it enough. Should be more consistent against double teams. Doesn?t impose his will as often as he could. Basic pass rusher without a winning, go-­to move or effective counter. Straight-­liner who cranks up initial push as bull-­rusher, but stalls out due to leverage loss. Needs to play with wider base to improve balance and base. Able to get upfield as an edge rusher, but rarely turns corner. Too content to lay on blocks when rush stalls rather than spin underneath or unleash a club move. Doesn?t play with the quickness or forward lean to threaten edges and win in the gaps.	John Henderson	Hard to find an interior lineman with a more well-­proportioned frame than Robinson. His size and overall talent level will have NFL teams drooling and projecting him along any and all defensive fronts, but his film might leave them hungry for more. As opposed to teammate Jarran Reed who already plays with polish, Robinson is a projection-­oriented two-­gapper who can step in right away and help plug holes in a leaky run defense. If Robinson can improve his leverage issues and pass rushing, he has all-­pro potential; however, he?s not a sure thing to become a star.	\N	88	6.58999999999999986	ashawn-robinson	\N
2555266	Alex	Balducci	10	75	308	\N	Balducci's statistics as a junior didn't put him on all-conference teams; he managed just 18 tackles (three for loss) in 2014. But Balducci stood out in the national championship game against Ohio State, and he stepped up his production this fall (40 tackles, 7.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks) and finally received the honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolade he deserves. NFL teams will see him as a late-round value, playing the role of space-eater with decent enough feet to keep gaps plugged and squeeze the pocket.	Generated some rush with a decent swim move as pass rusher. Greatly improved production from last season against the run finishing with 6.5 stuff and nine impact tackles. Has ability to improve his base with technique alterations with hands. Had adequate body control and change of direction.	Poor instincts and recognition. Doesn?t have the reactive athleticism to trump his slow diagnosis of the play. Gets behind in his snaps. Average play strength and poor hand usage. Will struggle at the next level getting off of blocks and defeating single blocks. Doesn?t have lateral quickness to pursue at an NFL level. Tries to win with spin move too often opening up his chest to defenders.	\N	Balducci has some size, but doesn?t have play with the functional strength and technique to match his frame as an interior lineman. Unless he improves his hand usage and is able to play with better instincts to cover up for his marginal athleticism, he will have a difficult time getting very far in camp.	\N	48	4.65000000000000036	alex-balducci	\N
2555267	Andrew	Billings	11	73	311	\N	Billings was already a big name around Waco before he even agreed to play for the Bears, dominating on the high school football field (266 pancake blocks in his junior and senior years) and setting a state record in power-lifting with 2,010 total pounds at the state meet (805 squat, 705 dead lift, 500 on bench). Despite the high expectations, he somehow lived up to his billing. After contributing as a true freshman (two starts, 29 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss), Billings came into his own in 2014, receiving consensus first-team All-Big 12 notice with 37 tackles, 11.5 for loss. The league named him co-Defensive Player of the Year in 2015, leading Baylor with 15 tackles for loss and tying for the team lead with 5.5 sacks as he heard his name mentioned on several All-American squads. The fact he led the Bears in tackles for loss and sacks shows the athleticism and aggressive nature of his game.	Elite power with a weight­lifting background. Generates booming power from hip explosion and when his leverage is on point, he can be menacing. Moved from offensive line to defensive line in college and is getting better by leaps and bounds each year. Drops his pad level even lower when splitting double teams and charging through gaps. Uses violent, powerful swats and slaps to free of opposing hand placement. Instant reaction time makes it difficult to cross his face. Gets arm extension into blocker and stays clean as he pursues laterally. Ridiculous closing burst to the sideline for a big man. Dominates single blocks and is a sure­fire tackler when he gets hands on a running back. Improving pass rusher with an effective bull­ rush.	Top heavy. Powerful but short. Once he gets going in a direction, struggles to slow down and change directions. Recovery athleticism is average. Plays with good initial effort but an average secondary motor. Still learning techniques for the position. Raw as a pass rusher relying on power over a plan. Extremely young to play professionally. Will need positive locker room leaders to guide him as he matures.	Chris Baker	Billings won't turn 21 until March of 2016, but he has the overwhelming strength of a full­-grown NFL defensive tackle. With elite power and unusual closing speed for a big man, Billings has a chance to become something we rarely see ­-- a playmaking nose tackle with the ability to dominate at the point of attack. Teams will decide through research and interviews whether Billings can handle the NFL life at such a young age, but if he can, he has all-­pro potential.	\N	10	6.44000000000000039	andrew-billings	\N
2555268	Anthony	Zettel	10	76	277	9.5	Most prospects don't train for the season by tackling trees, but Zettel isn't "most prospects" as a free spirit. He played inside and outside during a 2014 first-team All-Big Ten season in 2014 (17 tackles for loss, eight sacks, three interceptions), but wasn't able to quite create as much havoc when moved primarily inside as a senior (47 tackles, 11 for loss, four sacks, six pass breakups). He was a third team all-conference pick by league coaches and media as a senior, and will be valued for his toughness in the middle rounds of the draft.	Relentless motor. Doesn?t give offensive lineman a snap off with a lazy rep. Credited by Penn State with 38 tackles for loss over his career. Urgency ratchets up even higher when he smells a play is there to be made. Reads quarterback's eyes and steadies himself to time a leap into passing lane. Had six passes defended in 2015. Has decent lateral footwork and a functional spin move that can open opportunities for him.	Undersized interior lineman. Missing the necessary sand in his pants to take on double teams or down blocks without being pushed out of the gap. Gets mauled by power. Will struggle to leverage his gap with strength in the pros. May not have a natural position fit. Has short arms and can be controlled by length of tackles when playing outside.	Luis Trinca-­Pasat	Maximum effort defensive lineman who doesn?t have optimal length to play at a defensive end spot or the size to play inside. Zettel has some talent and a great motor which is why he's been as productive as he has over the last two seasons, but his traits and skill set may not translate into a lengthy NFL career.	\N	38	5.32000000000000028	anthony-zettel	\N
2555269	Austin	Johnson	11	76	314	9.875	Johnson is one of two Big Ten performers in his own family, as his sister, Kennedy, plays on the hardwood for Michigan State. He was an all-state performer in basketball during high school, and Cap-Atlantic Player of the Year as a senior, but as his 6-4, 325-pound frame continued to fill out, it was clear he belonged on the football field. Johnson sat out a redshirt season in 2012, then ate up room inside the next year, starting two games, making 27 tackles, two for a loss. In an honorable mention All-Big Ten sophomore season, Johnson saved his best for last, racking up seven of his 49 tackles (six for loss) for the year in a Pinstripe Bowl win over Boston College. Somehow while earning all-conference honors (third team from coaches, second team from media) in 2015, Johnson managed to earn his journalism degree with the hopes of joining a broadcast crew once his NFL career is over -? which might be a while given the size and athleticism he showed while accumulating 78 tackles, 15 for loss, and six sacks last season.	Exceptional size and girth with burly bubble, thighs and calves. Doesn?t carry much bad weight on his sizable frame and moves well for a big man. Plays with excellent hustle and pursuit. Rare tackle production for an interior defender with 75 this season. Won?t give in against double teams. Plants an outside leg and fights hard to hold his ground and maintain integrity of his gap. Fights through secure blocks and gets back onto play ­side. Plus instincts and awareness. Against shotgun rushing attacks, looks to set an early edge and has a nose for screen passes. Bull ­rusher who can walk a center deep into the pocket.	Doesn?t make hand usage a high enough priority at point of attack. Allows blockers into his frame forcing a much more labored disengagement. Has to change mindset from holding ground to winning quickly at point of attack. May not have desired length for classic, stack and shed nose. Showed signs of frustration with Ohio State's Jacoby Boren's tenacity. Can be knocked off-­balance early in rep when his pad level isn?t right. Needs to fire into blockers and take command of neutral zone. Not a penetrating pass rusher.	Dan Williams	Johnson has the lower body power to become a block­-eating nose tackle with the ability to keep linebackers clean, but his energy, pursuit and tackle production show that he is much more than that. Johnson has technique and pad level issues to improve upon, but he?s never content to just sit on blocks and he's very rarely dominated on a snap. Johnson's strength and activity will make him a draft favorite of salty defensive line coaches.	\N	38	5.98000000000000043	austin-johnson	\N
2555270	Carl	Nassib	9	79	277	10.375	One of the better stories of the 2015 college football season, Nassib went from preferred walk-on status to two years of special teams play to leading the nation in sacks (school record 15.5) and forced fumbles (six) in his senior year. Nassib garnered unanimous All-American honors for his efforts(19.5 tackles for loss) while also winning the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, Lombardi Award as the nation's top offensive or defensive lineman, the Ted Hendricks Award for the nation's top defensive end, and the Lott IMPACT (Integrity, Maturity, Performance, Academics, Community, and Tenacity) Trophy. Nassib was also a finalist for the Burlsworth Trophy for the player with the best career as a former walk-on, and the Nagurski Trophy as the nation's top defender. Now scouts have to figure out if Nassib is a one-year wonder or a true star in the making.	Desires to succeed and is relentless in his pursuit. Former walk-­on who was told by Bill O'Brien (then-Penn State coach) that he needed to forget about playing pro football. Was offered a scholarship six months later. Long levers with big hands and comes off the ball with good upfield burst. Has straight­-line speed. Excellent feel for navigating around the pass rush arc with maximum efficiency. Uses subtle hand play and lateral body lean to turn the corner and get after the quarterback. Comes off the ball with proper pad level and brings hips into contact to try and maximize his strength. Uses proper arm extension, plus vision and a well-­timed shed to attack running backs in his gaps. Smart, instinctive defender who is able to diagnose plays quickly. National sack leader despite missing two games. Forced six fumbles this season.	One-year wonder. Not physical at the point of attack and can be mauled by power. Thin through legs and needs more mass across his frame for improved base and play strength. Not much twitch as an athlete. Average change of direction and finds himself out of position to make tackles. Lacking agility and ends up on ground too often. More of a grab and drag tackler than bodied­-up finisher. Missed 10 tackles in 2015 and had just four run stuffs. His motor causes him to fatigue in spots. Relies on "wide­-9" launch-point for favorable angle around the corner as rusher. Lacks speed­-to­-power rush ability and needs to add more counter moves.	Trent Murphy	Nassib is a raw, inexperienced defensive end with an outstanding motor and the instincts and feel to make more plays than his athleticism might warrant. Football runs in the Nassib family and Carl is a willing, hungry worker who will have to improve his strength and add more wrinkles to his pass rushing approach in order to meet the projections that some teams have for him.	"He's an upside projection type. He's inexperienced, but still has height, weight, speed, length and now production." ­-- Midwest area scout	38	5.65000000000000036	carl-nassib	\N
2555297	Taylor	Fallin	7	78	339	\N	\N	Big, wide frame with above-average arm length and hand size. Plays with pretty good technique in run game and can generate some movement due to his massive size. Cut pressures, quarterback knockdowns and sacks down from last season. Can anchor against bull rush. Able to recognize twists and has above-average instincts. Rarely off his feet and on the ground. Played with better discipline in 2015, cutting his holding penalties from six to one.	Below-average athleticism. Sluggish long-­stepper off the snap and onto second level. Will have issues sustaining blocks on linebackers. Plays with plodding feet and has difficulty changing direction in pass protection. Very susceptible to inside moves. Counter moves can own him. Lack of twitch limits hip snap and initial pop at point of attack. Hand placement needs work.	\N	Fallin is a 23­-year-old, three-year starter who will turn 24 in November. His lack of flexibility and athleticism could limit his ability to be functional as an NFL tackle, and he might be too upright to move inside to guard and play with any leverage. Fallin should get into a camp, but could have a hard time sticking.	\N	60	4.76999999999999957	taylor-fallin	\N
2555271	Chase	Farris	6	77	310	\N	\N	Compact frame with stocky upper body and strength in his hands. Pass sets offer up good quickness in kick ­slides. Good sand in his pants and has the natural core to anchor up once bull­rush is underway. Flashes NFL power as a run blocker. Different player when allowed to fire out and create push. Caves in down­blocks and was able to widen running creases into gaping holes for Ezekiel Elliott. Many of his technical flaws will be correctable and he projects beyond his inconsistent tape.	Extremely raw with his technique and instincts. Played defensive line in 2013 and in high school and has very limited starting experience on offensive line. Pass protection was exceedingly sloppy as a tackle. Punch was often non­existent or was very poorly timed. Allowed rushers into his chest and edges without enough resistance. Average athlete in space. Leaves feet behind after contact causing issues with block security and balance. Takes inconsistent angles as run blocker and in pass pro. Slow and ineffective with cut­blocks.	Dakota Dozier	Former defensive lineman who, with more experience at guard, should be able to unlock more of his nasty once he?s able to react more and think less. His lack of experience and technique make him a project, but he has drive blocking traits that should be fleshed out by teams looking for power at guard. While the move inside should play more to Ferris? strengths, his issues with pass protection will take much more time to correct.	\N	37	5.20000000000000018	chase-farris	\N
2555272	Connor	Wujciak	10	74	291	\N	The Wujiack family has had great success in the college football arena, as Connor's brother Alex was a three-time All-ACC linebacker at Maryland and his father, Alan, played on the offensive line on Notre Dame's 1973 national championship squad. Wujiack had his best year as an Eagle in 2015, earning first-team All-ACC honors with 12 stops behind the line, including 4.5 sacks. This followed a third-team all-conference junior year (7.5 TFL, three sacks) and two seasons as a part-time starter (five as a redshirt freshman in 2012, nine in 2013).	Comes off the ball with low, square pad level and generally maintains it. Finds the football and mirrors down the line. Never allowed a broken tackle over four years. Better when he?s able to play in small spaces. Has big, strong hands. Football runs in his family with a father who won a national championship with the 1973 Notre Dame squad and an older brother who was an All-­ACC linebacker at Maryland.	Lack of girth limits effectiveness and production. Loses his run fit. Gets run past cutback lanes and washed down completely by powerful guards and centers. Struggles to drop a strong anchor when setting edge. Very little juice off the snap and is unable to activate a serviceable, NFL­-level bull rush. Has short arms and is easy to see and throw over for quarterbacks. Had no passes defensed over last two seasons.	\N	Smallish nose ­tackle who can handle his business when matched up against similar sized opponents, but who struggles to constrict rushing lanes with consistency when matched up against bigger, stronger interior blockers.	\N	22	4.82000000000000028	connor-wujciak	\N
2555273	Darion	Griswold	5	77	255	\N	Receiving statistics do not measure Griswold's potential; like many college tight ends, he is underutilized in the Red Wolves' offense. After a sophomore season where he earned second team All-Sun Belt honors with 24 catches for 312 yards and three scores, Griswold hasn?t had the opportunity to be productive in two honorable mention all-conference season (18 catches, 221 yards, four scores in 2014; just 13-187-2 in 2015). His size makes him an intriguing red-zone prospect and long strides allow him to threaten the seam.	Big body with some thickness in his lower half. Good straight-line movement for a big man and was used to challenge downfield. All-­state high school basketball player with ability to body up and catch the ball in traffic. Decent leaper. Dependable hands and tucks ball quickly to get up the field after catch. Technique as run blocker needs lots of work, but flashes some potential in that area if he can become more balanced at point of attack.	Takes awhile to come out of his stance and get into his routes. Labored gait when running. No separation quickness out of his breaks. Needs to play with more consistent play speed. Not a true in­line tight end and lacked production expected from a move tight end. Waist-­bending head-ducker as a run blocker and very raw. Will need to improve strength in his hands to latch onto his blocking targets.	\N	Intriguing tight end prospect who lacks eye­-catching production, but who has the size and basketball background that will get the attention of teams looking for a project to work with.	\N	66	4.96999999999999975	darion-griswold	\N
2555274	Dean	Lowry	9	78	296	9.375	The Chicago Tribune All-State pick decided to stay in-state to play for a Wildcats legend in head coach Pat Fitzgerald at Northwestern. Like Fitzgerald was during his time as a two-time Bronko Nagurski Trophy and Chuck Bednarik Award winner with the Wildcats, Lowry is a lunch pail player who brings effort on every snap. He?s also a better athlete than most people realize, showing the agility to spin off blocks and make plays in the backfield (15 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks in 2013-2014). His senior year capped an excellent career, with a highlight being his school-record six tackles for loss against Nebraska. He finished as a second-team All-Big Ten honoree with 46 tackles, 13.5 for loss, and three sacks. Lowry could play multiple spots along the line depending on his new team?s defensive scheme.	Comes off the snap with burst and good pad level. Gives chase on the backside with great motor and good play speed. Willing to pursue the ball with consistency or effort. When pad level is good, can generate effective speed-­to-­power attack. Has play frame to fit classic 3-­4 DE spot. Coaches praise his work ethic and team­-first mentality. Does the dirty work that helps others succeed. Always active. Tackle finisher who rarely allows runners to escape. Had as many tackles and more tackles for loss than Joey Bosa.	Short arms and small hands prevent him from posting higher win percentage at point of attack. Not as aware of the ball as he needs to be. Needs to unhinge from blockers earlier when runners are in his neighborhood. Gets stood straight up at contact as bull rusher. Pad level and narrow base rob him of bull-­rush power when rushing from inside. Dull, straight-ahead rusher with no pass rush plan. Doesn?t threaten the edges of blockers. Marginal play­making change of direction.	\N	Try-hard player with good size who is always active. While he won?t be considered a pass rushing threat, Lowry?s production was a function of effort and flashes of power and the aforementioned traits and qualities give him a good shot at being drafted and becoming an NFL backup.	\N	36	5.20000000000000018	dean-lowry	\N
2555275	DeForest	Buckner	9	79	291	11.75	It would be foolish for team to be wary of selecting Buckner because of the lack of success of former Ducks defender and number three overall pick Dion Jordan, as he's a completely different type of player. The 2015 Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year, Ted Hendricks Award finalist and member of multiple All-American squads (first team USA Today, second team AP, etc.) presents a thicker frame, portending an NFL career with his hand on the ground, rather than a stand-up pass rusher like Jordan. Buckner had become a name to note as a 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 pick (led team with 13 tackles for loss) after two seasons as a partial-year starter; he had 29 tackles and two starts, playing in every game as a true freshman in 2013, followed by a eight-start sophomore season (3.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks). He finished off his career in style (83 tackles, 17 for loss, Pac-12 leading 10.5 sacks), putting himself among the top prospects in the senior class.	Impressive NFL-­ready physique. Has natural strength and power in his hands and improved their effectiveness this year. Not a content player, Buckner plays with effort and will continue working hands and feet to improve his positioning. Light went on as pass rusher in 2015. Generated top-­end production by combining his power and dynamic athletic traits. Improved his pad level as rusher creating dominating pocket push that he was able to convert into sacks and knockdowns. Rare tackle production for defensive lineman with 163 over last two seasons. Long arms and good play speed allow him maximum field coverage to tackle. Flexible upper body. Can flip shoulders, then hips around the edge of blockers allowing him to play on the other side of the line. Has size and athleticism for scheme versatility. Quick off the snap and difficult to cut­ off in run game.	Plays too tall after the snap. Pad level so high that it impacts ability to stop and change direction with necessary body control. Needs to bend more when penetrating in order to avoid redirect blocks. Will need to play with wider base to take on blockers on next level. Has habit of turning shoulders and getting knocked out of position rather than taking on blocks with squared up pads.	Calais Campbell	Headed into this season, Buckner was a traits prospect who flashed with quickness, strength and overall athleticism, but he put those traits together in 2015. Buckner has the body type of a classic 3-­4 defensive end who can control the point of attack with length and power, but he has above average pass rush potential for that position which figures to push him into the early stages of round one. Buckner has similar power to former teammate Arik Armstead, but is a much better pass rusher and has a chance to become a dominant force in the NFL.	"His comp is going to be Calais Campbell or Arik Armstead but I think he's more talented coming out than either one of those guys. He's twice the player Armstead was coming out." -­ NFC Regional Scout	48	7.32000000000000028	deforest-buckner	\N
2555276	Devon	Cajuste	4	76	234	10.75	Cajuste is a similar prospect to the Carolina Panthers' second-round pick last April, Devin Funchess. Both have large receiver builds that can create mismatches in goal-line situations and in the middle of the field. Though he didn?t duplicate his outstanding junior year (34 catches, 557 yards, six scores -- two against Maryland in the Foster Farms Bowl) in 2015, a lack of opportunities seemed the most likely reason for his 27-reception, 383-yard, three-touchdown effort. Against Notre Dame in November, however, Cajuste showed his real potential by catching five passes for 125 yards and a touchdown against the Cardinal's rival.	Tall with a muscular frame. Play strength is above average and will fight for positioning. Reliable pass catcher with powerful hands. Able to post up and win the contested catch. Has traits to transition to H-back. Clean footwork and movements in his routes with a decent double move. Has some deceptive quickness out of stemming routes. Will work middle of the field without fear. Handles his responsibilities as a blocker. Good red zone target due to size and toughness.	Below average athlete for the position. Missing burst off the line and lacks second gear to generate push upfield to threaten cornerbacks. Cornerbacks will sit on his routes. Separation against NFL cornerbacks will be a struggle. Not a threat after the catch. Might not offer much special teams value.	Lance Kendricks	If this evaluation were purely as a receiving prospect, the draft grade would be lower; however, Cajuste might carry a higher grade as an H­-back or tight end which are the two positions where he should project. Cajuste is a willing blocker who also carries some third down and goal line value as a pass catcher which is why we are projecting him as an H-­back or move tight end.	\N	51	5.42999999999999972	devon-cajuste	\N
2555277	Eli	Apple	14	73	199	9.375	Though Apple was highly-recruited out of high school, Buckeyes head coach Urban Meyer wasn't sure of what he had during the New Jersey native's first year on campus. But Apple was diagnosed with an iron deficiency that prevented him from giving full effort on the field, in the weight room, and in the classroom. Once that was under control, Meyer and the rest of the coaches saw Apple begin to fulfill his potential. Apple (whose given surname was Woodard, but changed it to honor his stepfather) started 14 of 15 games as a redshirt freshman during Ohio State's run to a national title. In fact, he sealed the Buckeyes' win over Oregon in the championship game, intercepting Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota's final collegiate pass. For the season, he totaled 53 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three interceptions and 10 pass breakups. Although Apple's statistical production decreased in 2015 (33 tackles, two for loss, one interception, eight pass breakups), Big Ten coaches recognized his ability to shut down opposing receivers by voting him second-team all-conference.	Good height, weight and arm length combination. Clean footwork in transition with natural ability to mirror and match from press coverage. Won't open hips early and rarely turned around off line of scrimmage. Has foot quickness in short spaces to maintain feel for his man. Extremely competitive when ball is in the air. Has play strength to redirect receivers from their routes. Aggressive hands in coverage and fights hard to disrupt the catch by any means necessary. Finished with 22 passes defensed over last two years. Scouts praise him for work ethic and technical improvement over last two years. Will come downhill against run and is diligent with contain responsibilities.	Can be slow to diagnose and anticipate quarterback's plans. Average reactive athleticism. Doesn't feature the balance or twitch to rocket forward and challenge throws if he's not shadowing his man. Won't always play to his size as a tackler. Dragged 18 yards after a catch against Penn State. Shows some stiffness as an open field tackler and allowed four broken tackles this season. Slow to turn head and find ball on deep throws. Becomes Mr. Grabs if he senses receiver is getting over the top of him or when he's trying to crowd the top of routes. Had four holding and seven pass interference penalties from 2014­-2015.	Trumaine Johnson	Highly recruited two­-year starter who is entering the draft as a draft eligible redshirt sophomore. Apple's size and strength allows him to compete against physical receivers, but he also has the talent to mirror and match as a man defender. Covering for longer could be challenging early on after playing with talented defensive fronts who ravaged quarterbacks. Apple will have to learn to trust his feet rather than grabbing so often or he'll find that quarterbacks and refs will find him often.	\N	37	6	eli-apple	\N
2555278	Emmanuel	Ogbah	9	76	273	\N	Ogbah's family moved from Nigeria to the Houston when he was nine years old, with the hopes of finding a better way of life. The child given the middle name Ikechukwu (which means "God's power") flourished athletically in his new country, eventually becoming a finalist for the greater Houston high school defensive player of the year. He chose Oklahoma State partially due to his appreciation of former OSU offensive tackle Russell Okung, a fellow native of Nigeria who had great success with the Cowboys and in the NFL. Ogbah (AWG-buh) played in every game as a redshirt freshman, tying for the team lead with four sacks. Once inserted into the starting lineup, Ogbah starred, winning the Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year with 17 tackles for loss including 11 sacks. He played well again as a junior (17.5 tackles for loss, conference-high 13 sacks), earning Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year this time around, as well as All-American honors from USA Today, the Walter Camp Foundation, and others. The Ted Hendricks Award finalist couldn?t break through against Ole Miss tackles Laremy Tunsil and Fahn Cooper in the team's Sugar Bowl loss, but NFL scouts still see his potential as a top pass rusher at the next level.	Thick, powerful frame with broad shoulders. Came into school undersized but has grown into his frame with weight work. Able to absorb contact and play through it. Tough for linemen to redirect and is too much for tight ends one­-on-­one against the run. Some of the most power hand slaps you will find in college football. Able to brush away a weak punch with ease. At times, flashes unusual ability to trim the edge with power over speed. Uses power and a late rip move to win around corner. Plus speed­-to-­power rusher who created instant bull rush movement. Has power to win at the point of attack and capture the neutral zone while posting consistent production. Has posted a full sack or more in 16 of his last 21 games and finished 2015 with 17.5 tackles for losses. Has played both end positions, bumped inside and plays with a hand up and down.	Shows some stiffness in his hips and is not a dynamic athlete. Inconsistent awareness. Reaction time can be quick, but awareness of developing plays needs improvement. Short-­circuits his point of attack power when he turns his shoulders and gets washed down. Limited stride length hurts upfield burst. One speed pass rusher who is easy to find. Unable to burn the edges with quickness. Needs to disengage more quickly from bull rushes. Could stand to step up his motor and pursuit effort.	Charles Johnson	Upon first glance, Ogbah appears unimpressive because he doesn't play with the quickness or athleticism expected of productive pass rushers, but eventually, his translatable qualities avail themselves. Ogbah's power will serve him well against the run, but he will have to become more skilled as a pass rusher. He can play 3­-4 outside linebacker or 4-3 defensive end, and he might have value inside in sub­packages.	"He's stiff and upright so he has no counters as a rusher and then he doesn't even play hard all the time. If you are going to be the hulk, then play hard all the time." ­-- NFC area scout	18	6.16999999999999993	emmanuel-ogbah	\N
2555279	Jack	Conklin	7	78	308	10.375	In hindsight, it's difficult to comprehend that Conklin had zero scholarship offers from FBS-level colleges coming out of high school. The son of a high school football coach, Conklin had all of the tools to start with, which may have been why Michigan State came through with a preferred walk-on offer in the spring of 2012. He earned a scholarship halfway through his redshirt season, working over highly-recruited defensive ends in practice to earn their respect. Conklin started 13 of 14 games in 2013, 10 at left tackle and three on the right side, to earn multiple Freshman All-American honors. More people started taking notice of his toughness and strength in his sophomore season, as both league coaches and media named him a second-team Big Ten player at left tackle. Even though Conklin missed two games in his junior campaign with a leg injury, he garnered All-American recognition from nearly every outlet in addition to consensus first-team All-Big Ten honors for his ability to protect quarterback Connor Cook. Conklin's leadership and skills on the line during his final year in East Lansing helped the Spartans climb the Ohio State hump and capture a much-desired Big Ten Championship.	Scrappy with ability to recover when beaten. Showed Oregon's DeForest Buckner what time it was by bouncing him around at the point of attack. Plays with good core strength and impressive power in his hands. When he latches into defenders framework, he makes it difficult for them to disengage. Works well with guards in combination blocks. Leveraged second level climbs and careful not to climb too high and allow linebackers to slide underneath him. Makes strong initial contact as a run blocker and rolls hips up underneath him to uproot defenders and secure his blocks. Technically sound in pass protection with a wide base and ability to mirror. Consistently shoots inside hand first and lands his punch with good accuracy. Drops anchor like a door jam in pass protection sinking his rear and getting arm extension with inside hand placement.	Not a deluxe athlete and might have issues with NFL edge speed. Has a habit of "opening the gate" too quickly in his pass sets rather than maintaining a more squared pad level for longer. Able to stuff single rush moves, but average athleticism will be tested by counters. Always looks to win on the physical front and can be a little slow to work his feet into proper position after initial contact. Hands can get a little wide and grabby once he?s in space.	Jon Runyan	Possesses top flight size and strength at the tackle position and has the technique and recovery athleticism to make up for his average foot quickness. Conklin went from solid in 2014 to very good in 2015 and teams must now decide whether or not they want to give him a chance at left tackle or plug him in on the right side where he should be able to step in right away and become a quality starter. Conklin has some physical limitations, but he's got solid technique and exactly the field demeanor that offensive line coaches will be looking for.	"That is a dude, right there. He was busting up Ohio State in the fourth quarter of that game not because he was more talented than those guys but because he just wanted it more. He's tougher than old beef jerky. He fits in our division." -- ­ NFC North scout	34	6.40000000000000036	jack-conklin	\N
2555280	Jalen	Ramsey	14	73	209	9.5	Ramsey was a top-rated recruit (No. 10 overall by Rivals) out of Tennessee, stepping right into the fire in Tallahassee. In fact, he was the first freshman to start the opener at cornerback for the Seminoles since Deion Sanders 30 years earlier. Each year with FSU, he's garnered several honors, from Freshman All-American nod in 2013 () to All-American and first-team All-ACC accolades in both 2014 (79 tackles, 9.5 for loss, two interceptions, 12 pass break-ups) and 2015 (3.5 tackles for loss, 10 pass break-ups). Ramsey is not in Sanders? class as an athlete (though not many are), but he did win ACC indoor and outdoor long jump titles in 2015. And he has shown great versatility throughout his career, splitting time between cornerback and safety his freshman year, playing the Spur spot in 2014, before moving back to corner as a junior.	Dominant athlete. Sprinter and champion long jumper for Seminoles track team and hit a 40-inch vertical leap in high school. Prototype frame for a big, press­ cover corner. From press, lands accurate blows with extended arms into the shoulders of receivers. Can redirect and, in some cases, completely road­block a route with his disruptive press strength and tactics. Has experience at safety and as slot corner. Boundary corner in 2015 and quick to crowd outside releases against sideline. Shines in trail coverage. Has athletic ability to slam on brakes from full sprint and shadow comeback routes. Length and closing speed make it difficult to beat him over the top. Elite leaper who can challenge jump balls against anyone. Uses aggressive ripping and raking against catch attempts. Aware and instinctive from zone and off coverage. Diagnoses quickly and will stick a foot in the ground and drive hard towards the throw. Balanced, wrap-up tackler in space. Allowed a completion rate of just 38.5 percent.	Much better straight-­line player than lateral athlete. Shows hip tightness from press. Overreacts with feet to initial moves from press and can be knocked off balance by a clever release. Footwork and patience from press must improve or teams will match him up against quickness to test him. Missing fluid hips to open and run. Allows early separation in tight quarters and a clean passing window against crossing routes. Had no interceptions this year and just three for his career. Appeared to be a more fiery competitor in 2014. Would like to see him step downhill harder after run diagnosis rather than waiting for play to get to him. Can be a playmaking run­-thumper on one play, but then passive the next.	Sean Smith	Press ­cover corner with disruptive length to fluster receivers and the makeup speed/leaping ability to stymie downfield attacks. Ramsey made more plays on the ball from the slot last year, but his ability to jam and trail receivers limited playmaking opportunities this year. Ramsey has all-­pro potential and traits, but could use a little more bravado and attitude play in and play out.

2555281	Joe	Thuney	6	77	304	9.625	Thuney has played everywhere on the offensive line for the Wolfpack, beginning his career as back-up center as a redshirt freshman, starting at right tackle, right guard and left tackle in 2013, lining up at left guard in 2014 before returning to the blind side tackle spot as a senior. The second-team All-ACC pick has the strong versatility and potential for growth that NFL teams covet in a mid-round selection.	All-­ACC first-team selection in 2015. Doesn?t check all of the physical boxes scouts want, but his tasks get accomplished. Accurate initial engagement as run blocker, allowing him to sustain blocks longer and widen running lanes. Has played every position along the offensive line. Sharp and can process assignment changes quickly against run stunts. Sees twists and comes off of first blocks instantly to catch up with twisting rusher. Shows reactive athleticism to make quick counter step inside when needed.	Lean frame and thin through hips and thighs. Head-ducker and waist-­bender. Doesn?t trust his core strength and will lower head and lean into pass rushers opening up potential balance concerns. Needs to bring feet under him after contact. Consistent forward lean in all aspects of his game allow defenders to bounce him around. Not reliable cross-face blocker. Busy hands with too much wasted motion after the snap. Has short arms and small hands that will end up outside defender?s frame.	\N	Thuney is a three-year starter who has shown overall improvement in all aspects of his game and the position diversity that offensive line coaches love and need. Unfortunately, his lack of foot quickness and arm length make him an unlikely NFL tackle and his core strength and frame deficiencies will make a move to guard very difficult. Ultimately, center might be his only NFL shot.	\N	6	5.08000000000000007	joe-thuney	\N
2555282	Kenny	Clark	11	75	314	10.5	Kenny Clark, Sr., went to prison in 2005, leaving 9-year-old Kenny, Jr. to mature faster than most of the boys his age. With the help of his mother and others, Clark maintained a good relationship with this father and turned the adversity into a positive, working hard to become an excellent high school player. He started four games as a freshman in 2013 (31 tackles, four for loss, one sack), then stayed a fixture in the lineup the following year. The 2014 second-team All-Pac-12 selection (58 tackles, 5.5 for loss) graduated to all-conference first team as a junior, using his strength and agility to finish second on the Bruins in tackles (75), tackles for loss (11) and sacks (six) despite lining up in the interior. Clark also showed a knack for batting down passes, breaking up five on the year.	Former high school wrestler who can generate torque through upper body strength and leverage with power in his hips. Will hammer finesse guards and centers with initial punch and overtake the neutral zone. Quick to diagnose run direction and will race to set the edge against blocker. Low center of gravity and powerful core make him a challenging block to seal for linemen. Cranks up a nasty bull ­rush to collapse pocket when single blocked. Plays with plus instincts and football IQ. Has feel for trap blocks and double teams and is quick to read and react to screens. Can work his way through double teams and squeeze the gap.	Short and missing arm length to be better tackle finisher. Allowed unusual amount of broken tackles (4) for an interior lineman. Not a quick twitch athlete. Needs to do a better job of bringing feet and hips through contact. Gets too anxious pursuing down line and can lose backside contain. Despite strength, lack of size will be challenging in some matchups. Straight line bull­ rusher with average lateral quickness for twists.	David Parry	Has the strength and talent to be a plug and play 4-­3 nose, but lack of size and concerns about his value on third downs could push his draft value into the second day. Clark?s wrestling background gives him a huge leg up at the point of attack and he won't be 21 until October which means he?s still filling out his frame. Would benefit from a year of rotational work as he continues to physically mature.	"What bothers me about Clark is that he was so much better against weaker competition than he was against better talent. I like him, but not like everyone is hyping him up." --­ AFC Pac-12 scout	52	5.88999999999999968	kenny-clark	\N
2555283	Kivon	Cartwright	5	75	241	\N	\N	Angular tight end with long arms and huge hands. Hands look natural. Can use long arms to reach and pluck a sailing throw. Best when routes take him down the field. Long ­strider who has adequate build­up speed when challenging intermediate to deep. Allowed to run variety of routes and caught passes from all spots on the field. Saw seven of his 18 catches go for 20 yards or more.	Stiffness in his lower body creates mechanical movement. Not very fluid into his breaks and shows no wiggle to make defenders miss in the open field. Plays too upright into his routes. Can go high to catch a throw but not as effective adjusting to throws wide or behind him. Not very strong at the point of attack. Strong edge defenders can rag­ doll him around. Unable to handle NFL bull ­rush in pass protection.	\N	Cartwright missed his entire 2014 season due to injury issues, but came back and was relatively productive for Colorado State. His lack of mass and aggressiveness as a blocker are big strikes against him, while his stiffness when asked to venture outside of a straight line will limit his effectiveness getting open underneath.	\N	76	4.79999999999999982	kivon-cartwright	\N
2555284	Kyle	Carter	5	75	244	\N	Carter's numbers haven't matched his physical characteristics during his career at Penn State, though it may be interesting to see if his utilization improves in a pro setting. He came out of the blocks strong as a redshirt freshman, earning Freshman All-American honors with 36 receptions covering 453 yards and two scores before a wrist injury sidelined him. As a sophomore, he caught just 18 passes for 222 yards and a touchdown (a game-winner against Illinois in overtime). Carter ended his junior year with a bang, catching a touchdown to tie up the Pinstripe Bowl versus Boston College, allowing for the extra point to win the game. That was his only score for the year, however, on 16 catches for 153 yards. During his senior year, he fought an ankle injury that limited his effectiveness (14 catches, 135 yards).	Good athlete and very easy into his routes. Has speed to challenge vertically and over the top of middle linebackers. Good leaper with ability to climb ladder and snare a high throw. Quickness is there to be a more effective player in space. Could become a factor after the catch in the right scheme. Was split wide as matchup tight end in 2014 and could give walk­out linebackers trouble downfield. Able to cut block on the backside on zone plays.	Highly inconsistent adjusting to inaccurate throws despite his numerous opportunities over the last two years. Failed to prove he could secure contested catches. Hands are just average. Doesn?t seem to respond well with extra pace on the ball. Couldn?t separate thanks to rounded, ineffective routes. Not instinctive or physical as a blocker in space. Lacks toughness and size at the point of attack to matter in the run game.	\N	Failed to factor into offense in 2015 and has seen his productivity dip year after year. Carter is more H-back than true tight end, but his lack of focus and body control to make tough catches could hurt his stock since he?s not a consistent blocker. Carter has the athleticism to become a bigger factor in the passing game and maybe a more accurate passer and change of scenery will wake him up.	\N	38	5.20000000000000018	kyle-carter	\N
2555285	Leonard	Floyd	13	78	244	10.125	It?s tough not to think of former Georgia star linebacker Boss Bailey when watching Floyd, a long, lean pass rusher. An all-state pick in his Georgia high school days, Floyd played a year at Hargrave Military Academy before heading to Athens (as many Georgia recruits do). He started eight of 13 games played in 2013, receiving All-Freshman SEC notice after making 9.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks. Floyd was awarded the Bulldogs' Defensive MVP in 2014 (though he missed the team's bowl game having knee surgery) to go along with honorable mention all-conference honors from league media (8.5 tackles for loss, six sacks). In his final year between the hedges, Floyd led the Bulldogs in sacks for the third straight year (4.5) and tied for the team lead with 10.5 tackles for loss, garnering second-team All-SEC notice from league coaches. The 2015 Butkus Award finalist is no joke off the edge, as many college tackles would confirm.	Unique combination of length and athleticism. Extremely rangy with great chase speed from sideline to sideline. Good change of direction for taller player. Long limbs and twitch to spring into a tackle from a mile away. If unblocked, will chase down line of scrimmage from backside and foil run plans. Elusive in open space dodging blockers and sifting through traffic in pursuit of the ball. Has the traits to be highly effective in man coverage. As an edge rusher, able to shoot out of the starting blocks and cover substantial ground with long second and third strides. Not a great bender, but has ankle flexion necessary to lean at 45-­degree angle and buzz inside the rush arc. Substantial pass rush potential with a variety of options to the quarterback. Pet move is upfield burst followed by jump­-cut inside tied with inside club. Able to dip and rip around the corner. Dangerous on T/E twists and blitzes underneath. Able to worm his way through the A-­gap as standup blitzer.	All thin everything. Gangly frame produces marginal play strength. Built like a wide receiver and needs to live in a team cafeteria and weight room. Not an edge-­setter. Gets long arms into defender effectively, but struggles to gain extension. Loses fight for neutral zone at point of attack. Issues shedding blocks forces him into downfield tackler rather than backfield playmaker. Drag-­down tackler with little pop behind pads as a hitter. Must work to keep pad level lower on inside rush move.	Eli Harold	Floyd is painfully thin and will struggle to matchup with the strength of NFL players, but he is rangy in space, plays with a good motor and has traits as a pass rusher that would be a mistake to ignore. Floyd?s ability to cover close to five yards in three strides is rare for edge rushers. Add to that his inside counter and ability to play in space and you have a prospect who will be heavily scrutinized. Floyd?s lack of functionality could limit him to sub­-packages unless he proves he can add more beef to his frame.	\N	83	6.51999999999999957	leonard-floyd	\N
2555286	Luther	Maddy	10	72	287	\N	An undersized and active tackle once referred to by Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster as the "bell-cow" of the defense, Maddy returned to his old self in 2015, earning second team All-ACC notice from league coaches (57 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks) after an injury-shortened season the previous fall. He actually garnered honorable mention All-ACC status in that year despite playing in just four games (9 tackles, 0.5 for loss), partially because of the goodwill he built following a third-team all-conference junior year (13.5 TFL, 6.5 sacks) and solid sophomore campaign (35 tackles, 6.5 TFL, four sacks).	Plays with energy and effort until the whistle blows. Comes off the ball with outstanding quickness and can get into blockers early. Shows ability to swing from gap to gap with lateral quickness. Gets all he can from his arm extension and stays ready to shed. Quick twitch athleticism with hints of explosion in his upper body. Leverage allows him to post up against combination blocks. Uses sweet spin move to disengage and re-position against the run.	Has trouble stringing together moves if his initial quickness doesn?t put him in driver?s seat. Stubby frame with tiny hands. Plays with too much of square rusher?s mentality rather than a shoulder turner who can win around the corner. Positions himself to shed quickly but has trouble unhinging from strong hands. Can be overwhelmed by big guards who square him up. Too many ?almost? tackles and sacks. Missing the length to be a better finisher.	\N	Has intriguing quick twitch athleticism that allows him to get off the ball early and ahead in the rep. While he lacks the size and overall play strength to capitalize on his early quickness as much as teams might like, he does flash enough up-field ability and instincts to warrant a third-day selection as a rotational shade nose in a penetrating 4­-3 defense.	\N	28	5.24000000000000021	luther-maddy	\N
2555287	Nelson	Spruce	4	73	206	\N	One of the most productive receivers in college football in 2014, Spruce filled the stats sheet with 105 catches for nearly 1,200 yards and 12 scores. His senior year, however, was not as productive (84-942, three TD) partially due to the team's offensive limitations. While Spruce is not considered an explosive downfield threat, but he runs solid routes, fights for the ball in the air and is a reliable pass-catcher (he's the Pac-12's leader in career receptions) -- three important traits for a No. 2 or 3 NFL receiver.	Same guy every snap. Despite a high number of body catches, is extremely sure-handed dropping just three balls over last 288 targets. Willing over the middle and is comfortable in contested catch situations. Fearless, steady punt returner. Production off the charts. Broke Pac­-12 all-time mark in career catches. Will vary speed in routes and is clever with double moves. Knows how to set up a route. Uses plus play strength to fight through press. Technique not always there, but will strike with a purpose as a run blocker.	Marginal play speed and needs double moves to give him a shot over the top of cornerbacks. Cornerbacks know he can't run by them and squat on underneath routes. Compactly built with tight hips. Has noticeable balance issues running whip routes and is too tight to run sharp breaking routes with acceleration out of his cuts. Lack of get­away speed means he will always have company in a nearby defender. Short-limbed and not an explosive leader. Won't win many high­-point battles for the ball.	Danny Amendola	Spruce won't check very many of the athletic boxes needed to get drafted, but his overall toughness, production and hands should put him back on the draft radar. Spruce won?t appeal to everyone, but teams looking for a hard­-nosed slot receiver with value as a punt returner could bite on the third day.	"His production had our area scout over­-grading him, but once you get past what he can?t do and focus on what he can do you feel better about him as a late round guy who can help your team." --­ AFC general manager	11	5.37999999999999989	nelson-spruce	\N
2555288	Nick	Kwiatkoski	12	74	243	9.5	The heart and soul of the Mountaineers' defense (not to mention their leading tackler the past three seasons), Kwiatkoski (quit-KOW-ski) brings toughness to the field and is an explosive tackler. As a redshirt sophomore in 2013 starting at the Will spot, Kwiatkoski led the team with 86 tackles (6.5 for loss, two sacks) while also intercepting three passes. He made 11.5 tackles for loss among his 103 stops from the middle in 2014, and earned first-team All-Big 12 notice with his 86 tackles, ten for loss, three sacks, three interceptions, and seven pass breakups as a senior playing the Sam. Playing three different linebacker spots, while keeping the athleticism that he had as a high school receiver and safety, will gain looks from NFL scouts.	Has production that has filled up stat sheet for three straight years. Finished last three seasons with 275 tackles. Former safety with a feel for what is developing around him. Had 10 passes defensed this season and two seasons with three interceptions. Good balance to maneuver around trash and get to the tackle. Tough play demeanor and technically sound tackler. Chest up tackler who drives through his target to finish. Gets downhill with timing as a blitzer. Has aggressiveness and nose for the ball to become a special teams performer.	Scouts worry about his ability to match power at point of attack. Pad level is a little bit high and will run under blocks giving away his gap rather than leveraging it. Doesn't have the combination of burst and instincts to stay off of blockers. Needs to improve hand usage rather than taking on with shoulder so often. Questionable sideline-to-sideline speed.	David Mayo	Kwiatkoski is known for his weight room work and has transitioned his body type from safety to inside linebacker. He has some physical limitations that could prevent him from becoming a full-­time starter, but his mean streak and ability to finish as a tackler could serve him well as a special teamer which is likely how he will have to make a team.	\N	29	5.09999999999999964	nick-kwiatkoski	\N
2555289	Nick	Vannett	5	78	257	\N	Vannett grew up in Westerville, Ohio, where OSU football is King. Though he was not utilized to his full potential in the Buckeyes? passing attack, there?s no reason that he shouldn't be as valued as former teammate Jeff Heuerman, who was a 2015 third-round pick of the Denver Broncos. He has NFL size and hands, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten selection with 19 catches for 162 yards in 2015. Vannett had similar production (19-220) but more red zone targets (scoring five times) as a junior after spare usage as a redshirt freshman (two starts, 9-123) and sophomore (8-80, one TD).	Endowed with an all­-day NFL body type. Carries long limbs and big hands on a muscular, athletic frame. Comfortable hands in traffic and can make the heavily contested catch. Not afraid of taking a hit over the middle to secure the throw. Fluid mover and has the flexibility to sink and run sharp angle routes. Has body control and catch radius to pluck it high or low. Has size and ability to handle in­line blocking assignments and will battle once he?s locked into a one-­on-­one fight. Was trusted to help in pass protection. Lined up wide, in slot and as both move and in­line tight end. Finds his place against zone and works himself into open, easy throws for quarterbacks on the move.	Allows defender to crowd him on seam routes. Will need to improve hand fighting and leverage to create late separation for catches. Needs to be tougher at point of attack as a blocker. As move tight end, didn?t always fire downhill into his iso ­blocks. Allows defensive ends and outside linebackers to bring the fight to him. Routes need refining for better separation against man coverage. Run after ­catch potential not realized because his legs are easy targets for secondary to chop down.	Zach Ertz	Vannett?s combination of size and athleticism will be very attractive to teams in search of a combination tight end who can stay on the field and operate from a variety of personnel groupings and formations. Vannett will need to embrace his size and become more aggressive as a blocker, but his athleticism and pass catching ability could turn him into a safety blanket for a quarterback in need of a big, safe target.	\N	37	5.70000000000000018	nick-vannett	\N
2555290	Paul	McRoberts	4	73	202	9.75	\N	Tall with the frame to carry more weight. Played a year of college basketball and has ability to high point throws with the timing of a rebounder. Beats press coverage with basketball feet. Sinks hips into his breaks and can break routes off sharply when he wants. Gifted with extremely long arms and large hands for an elite catch radius. Can make difficult, one-­handed catches. Pluck and tuck ball­-catcher in traffic with natural, soft hands.	Doesn't have cushion-eating speed off the line of scrimmage to back cornerbacks off. Needs to do a better job of helping his quarterback out by working back to the ball. Shows inconsistent effort and play speed in his routes. Looks focused and hungry at times and lackadaisical at others. Can be slowed by contact along his routes. Can go get the high balls, but not as effective adjusting to low throws.	\N	McRoberts dwarfs cornerbacks with his long frame and upright gait and his ability to stretch and high point the high throws makes him seem even taller. His routes are raw and sometimes uninspired, but he has the feet and athleticism to become much better with more work and coaching. McRoberts appears to lack deep speed. Will be intriguing on the third day.	\N	360	5.24000000000000021	paul-mcroberts	\N
2555293	Shawn	Oakman	9	80	287	10.625	It doesn't take long to find Oakman on the field, as his frame and No. 2 jersey stand out even among the Bears' top competition. Considering the difficulties he had growing up (his late father out of the picture, his mother was a cocaine addict, tested positive for HIV and spent time in prison), it?s difficult to imagine how he?s made it this far. He almost lost his way during his redshirt season at Penn State, where he was kicked off the team after attempting to steal a sandwich from a campus cafeteria because he was out of meal credits. It was a bit of a surprise when the massive lineman decided to return to school for the 2015 season, as he likely would have been an early-round pick after recording 19.5 tackles for loss (11 sacks) as a junior. His production was down considerably in 2015 (14.5 TFL, 4.5 sacks), though Big 12 coaches still named him a second team all-conference selection. Oakman will be a polarizing figure in draft rooms across the league due to juxtaposition between his physique and production.	One of the most long-­levered pro prospects you will ever see. Built like Adonis from the waist up with thunderous power in his hands. Able to create instant bull rush thanks to arm extension and explosive hips. Can bench press tackles to set a very strong edge. Has some 2-­gap ability when he plays square to the line of scrimmage and maintains a wider base. Incredible length puts him in position to make tackles when the ball drifts anywhere near him. Raw, but has tools and traits necessary to improve as a pass rusher if he puts the work in.	Body type of a praying mantis with well-built upper and skinny legs. Will always struggle with his high center of gravity. Must create more knee bend as part of his muscle memory reflex to improve his balance. His pass rush consists of bull rushing or bull rushing. Occasionally windmills hands to try and swat away punch to turn the corner but mostly ­bull rushing. Menacing power only evident in straight line. Doesn't have leverage or lower body power to translate play strength throughout his movements. Upper body and lower body don't seem coordinated.	Earl Okine	While Oakman was the cause celebre of national media types after images of his tremendous upper body build emerged, he has always been more project than polish as a defensive end. While Oakman has limited upfield burst and no counters as a pass rusher, his length and ability to set a hard edge are no joke and his traits should get him drafted much higher than his tape warrants. Oakman could develop into a better pass rusher, but his lot may already be cast as a run­-stopping 3­-4 DE or 4-­3 base end.	"He's going to get beat up but I'll take a guy who has his size and power. Those guys make it in the league and they usually get better too. He's not a pass rusher, he's disruptive against the run. That is who you have to draft." -- AFC executive	10	5.61000000000000032	shawn-oakman	\N
2555294	Shilique	Calhoun	9	76	251	9.875	Not many players are named to All-American squads once during their college career, much less twice. Calhoun's managed to earn the nod three straight years, making big plays for the Spartans as they competed for Big Ten titles. As a redshirt sophomore, Calhoun was the Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year and first team all-conference recognition in addition to second team All-American notice from several sources after recording 14 tackles for loss, 7.5 sacks, four fumble recoveries and an interception. The two-time Ted Hendricks Award finalist (2013, 2015) didn?t disappoint in his second year as a starter and first as a team captain, making 39 tackles, 12.5 for loss and eight sacks. Calhoun could have left for the NFL after 2014, but decided to return to compete for a Big Ten title and a national championship. The Spartans did accomplish the former, with the help of Calhoun?s 14.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks before losing to eventual champion Alabama in the College Football Playoff.	Former high school basketball standout with an athletic, well-­proportioned frame. Three-­year starter with above average pass rush production. Posted 128 quarterback pressures and 26.5 sacks over last three years. Rushes passer with forward lean and good knee bend. Keeps running after contact to better position. Improving shoulder dip around corner to run the arc tightly and get after the quarterback. Flashes above average burst to the quarterback when sack is in his sights. Good play recognition and awareness in run game. Good backside chase speed against the run and able to change directions when needed. Two-­time team captain under Mark Dantonio who is highly respected in the building. Has shown potential for more complex pass rush attack using several different rush moves from various angles.	Missing aggressive, nasty play demeanor at point of attack. Showed too much respect to blockers rather than playing through them with aggression. Gets caught up in slap-fighting rather than dominating with hand strength. Can improve feel for when to use power and when to use finesse as a rusher. Flagged for nine encroachment penalties this year. Needs to play faster. Play strength doesn?t match his frame. Won?t often whip a base block and gives in too easily to double team coming from tight end. Wasn?t a factor in the opposing team?s backfield in 2015.	Andre Branch	Calhoun?s career could go one of two ways -- he?ll become more aggressive and improve his hand usage which will unlock his full potential as an NFL defensive end OR he will become a decent NFL starter who doesn?t have the upfield burst to win up the field as a pass rusher and isn?t strong enough to hold up at the point of attack. Calhoun may need to become tougher against the run before he is handed a starter?s position, but the skill­set is there if he can unlock it.	\N	34	5.74000000000000021	shilique-calhoun	\N
2555295	Sterling	Shepard	4	70	194	9.75	Shepard wears the same jersey number (3) as his late father, Derrick Shepard, who lettered for the Sooners as a receiver in the 1980s. Despite his slight frame, Shepard's toughness, strong hands, and quick cuts make him the sort of in-space player NFL offensive coordinators want working the middle of the field. Shepard?s production greatly increased from his second-team All-Big 12 2014 season (51 catches, 970 yards, five touchdowns) to his USA Today second-team All-American senior season (86-1,288-11).	Silky smooth with terrific route quickness. Plays with consistent play speed into and out of his breaks and can hit the gas out of his breaks to create instant separation for anticipatory throws. Runs variety of routes from the slot. Almost impossible to stay with his "whip" route. Clean with his double moves and if cornerbacks bite, is able to get over the top to track throws and run under them for the big play. Will adjust routes to ball placement. Not afraid over the middle. Born to catch a football. Just eight drops with 253 catches and is able to adjust to high, low or behind him for difficult catches. Loves to compete. Willing to jump into a cornerback and get after him as a blocker from slot. Takes pride in his work ethic and scouts say his personal and football character is extremely high. Was a talented basketball player and long-jumper in high school.	Not very big and lack of play strength will show up from time to time. Won't see as many free releases in pros. Strong cornerbacks with good feet can cause issues for him in press coverage. Can be redirected in his routes and will get trapped against the sideline at times. More quick than fast and reliant upon clever routes to get over the top against true speed. Not much of a catch radius. Can get too cute with amount of moves off release or underneath routes.	Tyler Lockett	The similarities in backgrounds, playing style, production and football character and between Shepard and Seattle's Tyler Lockett are obvious. Shepard doesn't possess Lockett's explosiveness as a return man, but is a better overall receiver. With more and more teams using "11" personnel (3 WRs) as their base offense, Shepard's stock should be on the rise. Teams looking for a slot receiver who can make plays and rack up a high volume catch count on any given Sunday will find their man in Shepard.

This more than doubled his total production from his sophomore (9-123, one TD) and redshirt freshman (8-45, one TD) seasons. The 2014 second-team All-SEC pick?s production dropped off in his season year due to a team-wide lack of efficiency (26-231, one TD) and an injury causing him to miss one game. He was, however, still a candidate for the Wuerffel and William V. Campbell Trophies and the Senior CLASS Award for his efforts on and off the field.	Helped out inaccurate quarterback. Showed body control to make adjustments to throws behind him. Able to make contested catches in a crowd. Aware of oncoming traffic and tucks ball away quickly while adjusting his path after the catch. Takes good angles to blocks in space and shows ability to mirror and wall off safeties.	Average athleticism and won?t be out­running safeties or linebackers down the seam anytime soon. Unable to create separation through quality routes or acceleration out of his cuts. Slow to get his head around and find ball. Allows throws to get on top of him. Had three drops this season. Gives effort but not big enough or strong enough to block in­line as NFL tight end.	\N	Productive college tight end lacking the size to be an effective blocker as a combination tight end or the athleticism and speed to start as a move tight end or h-­back.

2555298	Travis	Feeney	13	76	230	9.5	Feeney made a name for himself with an outstanding senior year, as well as a memorable haircut. To pay tribute to people who he knew who passed away from breast cancer, including his aunt, Feeney had a pink-dyed awareness ribbon shape cut into his hair. It's not that he needed to do so to make himself known on campus, as he had already made an impact for the Huskies, being named the scout team Defensive MVP in 2011, honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick the following year (76 tackles, six for loss, four sacks), a nine-game starter and team Special Teams Player of the Year in 2014. His senior year was his best, however, as he replaced NFL draftee Hau'oil Kiahaha at the Buck position and earned second-team All-Pac-12 notice with 17.5 tackles for loss and eight sacks.	Production and consistency improved across the board. More confident, accurate tackler dropping his missed tackles from 11 (2014) to three this year. Rangy former safety who can cover ground in pursuit. Adequate lateral movement and uses hands to create separation from blockers. Uses arm­-over as his go-­to rush move. Competitive with an aggressive demeanor. Willing to mix it up. Able to stretch plays and push them towards sideline. 2015 team captain. Consistently productive over four years on coverage teams.	Wiry frame produces very little speed­-to-­power potential as pass rusher. Spindly legs fail to hold their ground at point of attack. Won?t set a strong edge. Can be tilted due to lack of functional base. Doesn?t have the play strength to fight through redirect blocks. His elevated pad level and lean body type are usually indicators of inconsistent tackling on pro level. Has had multiple shoulder surgeries and issues with both shoulders that could red-­flag him at the combine.	Ray Ray Armstrong	Has worked hard to transform his body from safety to linebacker, but is still lacking the frame and strength to consistently hold his ground at the point of attack. Feeney?s competitiveness and ability to play in space could help him transition into a more natural role of 4-­3 WILL linebacker and his coverage talent on special teams gives him a shot to break camp on the 53.	\N	53	5.11000000000000032	travis-feeney	\N

He was the National Defensive Player of the Year by the Touchdown Club of Columbus as a senior high school, a finalist for the Florida Mr. Football award, and the Most Valuable Player of the Under Armour All-American game. So it was no surprise that he worked his way on the field as a true freshman, ranking among the leaders in the SEC with 14 passes defended, including three interceptions. Hargreaves not only earned first-team All-SEC honors in all three of his seasons in Gainesville, but also lined up multiple All-American honors in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass breakups) and 2015 (four interceptions, four pass break-ups) due to his playmaking ability.	Premier, quick twitch athlete with explosion pulsing through his hips and feet. Instant click-­and-­close action to explode forward and attack the throw. Vertical springs to go up and over receivers at the high point. Smooth, controlled backpedal with ability to weave and mirror route progressions. Plays with outstanding body control and balance. Feet are electric. Can overwhelm lesser opponents across from him. Instinctive and urgent in his play. Excels from press, off or zone coverage. Fiery competitor with a strong desire to own the pass. Has quick, soft hands. Posted 38 passes defensed and 10 interceptions over last three years. Could see early kick or punt return action. Unwilling to stay blocked and doesn't hesitate for one moment in run support and against wide receiver screens. Chest­-up tackler who runs through his target.	Lean, wiry frame. Aggressive nature allows teams to bait him with double moves. Quicker than fast and doesn't have closing speed to make mistakes underneath and still recover on top. Allowed 16.5 yards per completion this season. Scouts worry about his height outside. Big receivers will pose a challenge on the next level. Had his two worst games of the season in SEC Championship game against Alabama and Citrus Bowl against Michigan. Willingness to throw body around in run support could cause him to break down.	Joe Haden	While scouts have voiced some concerns about Hargreaves' size and recovery speed, you won't find anyone who doesn't admire his competitiveness and consistency of production. Hargreaves has a level of suddenness and explosiveness in his movements that should always have him near the ball. With top-notch ball skills and exceptional instincts that drew praise from Alabama's Nick Saban, Hargreaves possesses the football makeup to become a Pro Bowl cornerback.	\N	82	6.70000000000000018	vernon-hargreaves	\N
2555300	Victor	Ochi	9	73	246	10.125	Ochi's a Long Island boy, growing up a stone's throw from JFK Airport in Valley Stream, and then moving on to Stony Brook University. Even though most college football fans haven't heard of the Stony Brook Seawolves, they should know Ochi's (o-chee) name. The New York all-state pick's college career began with a bang in his redshirt freshman season, starting five games, making 45 stops, 7.5 for loss, and one sack. He harassed ball carriers in the backfield even more regularly as a sophomore (nine starts, 33 tackles, 10 for loss, 5.5 sacks) before starting his collection of postseason honors in 2014 by garnering first team All-Colonial Athletic Association honors (57 tackles, 16.5 TFL, 11 sacks). Ochi's ascension continued through his senior year, as he took home CAA Do-Defensive Player of the Year honors after leading the FCS with 13 sacks in the regular season (among 16.5 total tackles for loss) on a defense led the nation in fewest yards allowed.	Plays standing up or with a hand down. Sets a nasty edge with a thunderous punch that jars lower end competition. Constricts running lanes and looks to dive down the line of scrimmage to make tackles. Active, heavy tackler. Loves the game and plays with toughness. Able to decimate FCS tackles with punch, snatch and tug move that sends them to the ground. Will run right through soft-­edge tackles on the way to hit the quarterback. Has long arms and gets adequate extension at point of attack. Holds Stony Brook records in tackles for loss and sacks.	Smaller than desired for an edge defender. One­-speed pass rusher who plays with square pads over shoulder turn and hip flip around the edge. Stiff mover in space. Ill equipped to drop in space or cover. Hand usage is somewhat basic. Pass rush lacks spontaneity and allows rep to play out rather than controlling it with counter moves. Snap anticipation and recognition of play flow needs to speed up. Level of competition was substantially below the NFL level.	J.R. Tavai	Ochi dominated his competition with explosive power and high-­octane effort. While his production looks inspiring, his opposition rarely played with enough functional strength or athleticism to warrant a camp invite. Transitioning to NFL speed and strength will be a huge jump for Ochi, but he has the translatable power and nastiness to compete for a roster spot as a physical, edge-­setting 3­-4 outside linebacker.	\N	394	5.37000000000000011	victor-ochi	\N
2555301	Blake	Frohnapfel	1	78	238	\N	With Rakeem Cato eating up playing time at Marshall, Frohnapfel (pronounced FROH-nap-ul) decided to head to Massachusetts for his final two seasons. He excelled in his first year as a starter, earning first team All-Mid-American Conference recognition after throwing for 3,345 yards and 23 touchdowns despite missing the final two games of the year with an ankle injury. But NFL teams didn?t see much improvement in his consistency or accuracy in his final campaign (55.1 completion percentage in 2014, 56.4 in 2015) and his 16-13 TD-to-INT ratio last season kept him off all-conference teams.	Tremendous size and overall build for the position. Tall enough to see over the offensive line and has the thickness of frame to hold up physically. Senses pressure and slides around in pocket to open space. Showed poise dealing with poor snaps, yet staying on schedule. Won't drop his eyes when rush is in his face. Decent weight transfer and follow through into his throws. Can drop a Cover­ 2 throw in the bucket.	Poor production with just 16 touchdown passes in 529 dropbacks. Threw entirely too many interceptions in the red zone. Stares down targets with white-­hot intensity drawing a road­ map for linebackers to run right into interceptions. Makes too many decisions based on pre-­snap alignment rather than post-snap reads. Plodding setup in the pocket and has a small wind­up leading into his slow release. Arm strength is nothing special. Doesn't have the escapability from the pocket. Poor accuracy on deep throws (25.9 percent).	\N	Frohnapfel might have NFL size, but he doesn't have enough arm to overcome the turnovers that could plague him thanks to his slow release and penchant for looking down targets. Maybe his size will get him into a camp, but unless he has a banner post­season, it?s hard to see his game tape getting teams excited.	\N	269	4.75	blake-frohnapfel	\N
2555302	Brandon	Doughty	1	75	213	9.125	Doughty put up one of the most productive back-to-back season passing performances in college football history the past two seasons. He was the Conference USA MVP in both 2014 and 2015, and won the 2014 Sammy Baugh Award winner as the nation's top quarterback while finishing as a finalist for the Manning Award for his senior season. He passed for 4,830 yards and 49 touchdowns as a junior while only throwing 10 picks in 552 attempts. Doughty followed that by leading the Hilltoppers to a C-USA crown and leading the FBS in passing yards (5,055) and touchdowns (48) for the second straight year. He also led the nation in completion percentage, finding his target 71.9 percent of the time. Doughty was in uniform at WKU for six seasons, receiving a sixth year from the NCAA due to losing most of the 2011 and 2012 seasons due to injury.	When he feels protected, can play a confident and intelligent brand of football. Strong understanding of the system and his options against every coverage. Reads safeties well and is willing to attack the deep middle. Comes in with a pre­-snap plan. Throws catchable ball with good touch. Able to play pitch and catch when he's in rhythm. Can drop a deep ball in the bucket with good air under it. Works through progressions and isn't a "Checkdown Charlie." Hits receivers in stride on vertical throws.	Lacking NFL-­caliber arm strength. Doesn't have enough zip to challenge cornerbacks on field side throws. Will have to learn to live off of timing throws to compensate for lack of velocity. Can be rattled in the pocket and will throw without feet being set rather than sliding around in the pocket. LSU game got too big for him. Appeared to lose confidence and began rushing throws and footwork fell apart. Doesn't have athleticism to escape the rush or make plays with his legs.	\N	There are several games where Doughty plays with confidence, great accuracy and a winning understanding of his offense. However, when the heat is on he shows a lack of poise that can affect his footwork and touch. Doughty is missing an NFL arm or plus athleticism, but his production and ability to get through his progressions will get him a shot to prove the "system quarterback" label wrong.	"I liked him a lot better this year and he really knows how to run that offense but there was a play against North Texas where he scrambled out of the pocket and had a chance to dive in for a touchdown but slid at the 1-yard line rather than take the hit and make the play. That's not good enough." -- NFC Southeast area consultant	444	5.11000000000000032	brandon-doughty	\N
2555303	Cory	James	13	72	229	\N	One of the more consistent playmakers in the country over the past four years, James has flown under the radar a bit playing in Fort Collins for the Rams. He received well-deserved recognition after his senior year, as Mountain West coaches voted him second-team All-Conference as he had double-digit tackles for loss (10 of 65 tackles, with two sacks) for the third time in four seasons as a starter. James was named a Freshman All-American by the Football Writers Association of America (54 stops, 10.5 for loss, 7.5 sacks) and produced in both his sophomore (60 tackles, 12 for loss, eight sacks) and junior (51 tackles, 8.5 for loss, 6.5 sacks) seasons.	Used as an edge rusher in obvious passing downs during his time at Colorado State. Rushes with upfield burst and is able to dip and bend under the arc to attack the passer. Made switch to middle linebacker in this year and improved along the way. Athletic in space and accelerates into his tackles. Flashes awareness needed to weave under traffic and find running backs.	Raw with technique in the middles. Struggled to understand proper leverage to the sideline. Inconsistent in his play following a splash play with a mental mistake. Will make a wrong read and lose his run fit. Slow to drop into space in coverage. Needs to play with a decisive punch to stay separated from blockers and keep from being engulfed. Play strength is average.	\N	James moved to middle linebacker this season, but that isn't where he will be cast by NFL teams. James posted 15.5 sacks combined in 2013 and 2014 and has the flexibility and quickness that makes him an interesting edge rushing candidate. James isn't consistent enough to warrant time on an NFL field yet, but his athleticism and potential to get after the passer gives him a puncher's chance.	\N	76	5.08000000000000007	cory-james	\N
2555304	Cory	Johnson	10	75	300	\N	Johnson signed with Temple coming out of high school, but decided to follow the junior college path instead. He starred at tiny ASA College in Brooklyn, New York, earning All-Conference notice for his 15 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks as a sophomore. Johnson signed with Kentucky instead of Miami or Texas Tech, and his game proved SEC-worthy. He played as a reserve in 2014 (10 tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks) before taking a starting role last season (67 stops, eight for loss, two sacks). One of the highlights of the 2015 college football season was watching Johnson return a fumble 77 yards for a score.	Good lateral quickness to fight against secure blocks and get to the play ­side. Able to shuffle down the line in pace with the play. Had two double-­digit tackle games. Plays with squared shoulders. Has upper body twitch. Flashes upfield quickness as a penetrator. Shows potential as interior pass rusher with quality motor and compact rip move.	Has just one season of full-­time SEC work under his belt. Has short legs and long torso. Instincts are a work in progress. Fooled by zone read and play­-action and can be slow to find the football. Raw with hand usage at point of attack. Needs to learn to punch and extend for improved ability to come off blocks. Loses one­-on­-one matchups against power.	\N	Johnson came to Kentucky from a junior college and wasn't a factor in 2014 before posting quality production as a starter in 2015. He lacks the build and lower body strength to consistently hold the point of attack, but he does have qualities as a one-gap worker that should land him in camp and potentially on a practice squad as he continues to gain experience.	\N	84	5.25999999999999979	cory-johnson	\N
2555305	Cre'von	LeBlanc	14	69	194	\N	D'Joun Smith played on the other side of the field from LeBlanc in 2014, and was picked in the early third round by Indianapolis -- despite his talent, he was often challenged by opposing quarterbacks. Why? Because LeBlanc was just as tough to throw against. Former FAU head coach Carl Pelini said LeBlanc was recruited specifically for his versatility as a cover man/run stopper/blitzer. Given the production the FAU Defensive MVP and second team All-Conference USA corner put up despite being "the man" as a senior (four interceptions, seven pass break-ups), it won't be surprising if the Owls find one of their corners picked in the third round for the second straight year.	Stocky, muscular build. Plays with exceptionally strong hands clutching and challenging receivers from press. Allowed just 34.5 percent completion rate in 2015. Impressive mirror and match footwork to stick to his targets and stay in position to make plays on the ball. Aggressive in coverage and competes hard at the top of the route against physical receivers. Quick twitch athlete with explosive hips to leap and defend 50/50 throws. Has kick return ability.	Too small to play outside. Doesn't have desired recovery speed if beaten over the top. Lack of top-end speed and length could create substantial issues defending deep throws. Can be forced out of the way in run support by big­-bodied receivers with good arm extension. Relies too heavily on grabbing and holding when routes stem.	\N	Hard not to love his competitiveness and ability to match a receiver's footwork off the line of scrimmage, but those qualities might not be enough for teams who push short cornerbacks down their draft boards. LeBlanc might need to run a fast 40-yard dash in order to give him a chance to hear his name called on Day 3 of the draft as a slot corner and kick returner.	\N	211	5.01999999999999957	crevon-leblanc	\N
2555306	David	Morgan	5	76	262	10.5	UTSA has only had a football program for five years, and only been a full-fledged member of the FBS for two years. So it was a bit of a surprise when Morgan was named a second-team All-American and second-team All-Conference USA selection 2015, finishing among the leading tight ends in the country with 45 receptions for 566 yards and five scores while also showing a willingness to block. Morgan did flash talent early in his career, catching 13 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns, mostly as a reserve, in 2011. Morgan redshirted the following year due to injury and managed just seven catches for 69 yards in his return in 2013. He earned honorable mention All-Conference USA recognition as a junior, nabbing 20 passes for 255 yards and a score while missing more time with another injury.	Go-­to target for his team and handled the workload and responsibilities with confidence. Very sure hands. If he has space, he's going to secure the catch regardless of hits coming. Plays bigger than listed size. Has instincts and determination to block. Centers his target and works his feet through contact to secure blocks. Former high school basketball player with leaping ability and plus body control. Used in jump-­ball situations and was often the winner. Moved around the field and has the blocking ability and intelligence to be a fullback or H-­back candidate as a pro.	Flagged seven times including two holding penalties and four false starts. Half-­strider whose feet look like they barely leave the ground when he runs. Gets into his routes with heavy feet. Tight hips prevent him from stemming routes sharply to create separation. Pronounced movement gives route progression away early. Doesn't have the deep speed to back defenders off of him and is forced to make a living with contested catches.	\N	Lunch­-pail tight end whose versatility, consistency and production landed him a second-team All-American nod. Morgan's lack of quickness will hurt his ability to get open as a receiver, but his willingness to block and potential to become a move tight end who can handle fullback responsibilities should help his cause on the third day of the draft.	\N	6919	5.16999999999999993	david-morgan	\N
2555307	Devante	Bond	13	73	235	9.25	It took Bond's career a while to get going, but the flashes he showed while playing in Norman gave NFL scouts something to think about. He didn't start playing football until his senior year of high school, and then went to Sierra Community College for two years where he was the conference Defensive MVP with 27 tackles for losss, 17 sacks in just 11 games. He wanted to sign with the Miami Hurricanes for the 2013 season, but he was one course short of reaching academic eligibility so he did not play at all that fall. Enrolling at OU in January, he parlayed his spring work into a strong role in 2014, starting three games a outside linebacker (29 tackles, four for loss). His senior year didn't live up to expectations, as an ankle injury caused him to miss four games. Bond did start five games, though, racking up 43 tackles, seven for loss and three sacks.	Shows ability to shed blocker with quick, active hands and arm­-over move. Plays with good body control and very little wasted motion. Reacts quickly to what his eyes tell him. Takes coaching and builds on it. When run flows away from him, will immediately squeeze on the backside and look to limit cutback lanes. Not a plus athlete but has the low center of gravity and feet to transition movement quickly when change of direction is needed. Plays with consistent effort. Adequate in zone coverage and actively looks to limit passing windows.	At times, gets caught drifting away from oncoming linemen and opening door for running back to zip through vacated area. Inconsistent at recognizing bootlegs and play­-action passes. Has best intentions of setting edge, but can get swallowed up pushed off the spot by big, in­line tight ends. Average athleticism with pedestrian speed in space. Lack of length and twitch may limit his play­making when ball run right at him in the pros. Man coverage could be a challenge against speedy targets.	Spencer Paysinger	Competitive, 4­-3 linebacker prospect who often played 3­-4 outside linebacker in college. On tape, Bond looks like a fairly average athlete with limited speed which could hurt his draft stock, but scouts like the way he applies coaching and plays with effort and consistency. Bond might have to earn his way onto a team through special teams play early on, but I wouldn?t bet against him.	"He's got a better chance of making it in the pros than (Eric) Striker in my opinion.

2555308	James	Cowser	9	75	248	10.25	One of the most productive players in the Football Championship Subdivision in 2014 (28.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks in 2014), Cowser used strong hands and a great motor to beat tackles again in his senior campaign (19 tackles for loss, 13 sacks, four forced fumbles). In fact, he set FCS records for career sacks (42.5) and tackles for loss (80) last season, his second straight season garnering All-American notice from the Walter Camp Foundation, the Associated Press, and other outlets. Cowser is a bit older than the typical draft prospect because he redshirted at SUU in 2009 before heading to a two-year LDS church mission. Combining that maturity with strength, intensity and production makes for an intriguing prospect.	Has a high­-end motor that never stops. FCS Defensive Player of the Year. Active pass rusher with quick hands and well­timed hand swipes at the top of his rush. Rushes from both ends and has a tight, basketball spin move from either direction that puts him in position to win. Quick second and third steps for darting inside moves. Sheds with proper timing to make the tackle. Studious in classroom and film room.	Funky body type with relatively thin limbs, but broad hips. Play speed masks a lack of twitch and explosiveness. Feet gather and stall before leaving the starting blocks or changing directions. Limited stride length to gain ground as rusher off the line of scrimmage. Unsettled feet at point of attack lead to balance battles. Needs to set edge with a wider base for greater power and control.	Zack Wagenmann	When it comes to production, there is nobody better in FCS history than Cowser who owns the all¬time records in sacks (43) and tackles for loss (80). Cowser's above average hand usage, diversity of attack and relentless motor were the keys to his FCS success, but he has to prove he is athletic enough and strong enough to become a productive NFL starter as a 3-4 outside linebacker. At worse, Cowser is a backup and special teams ace.	\N	380	5.41999999999999993	james-cowser	\N
2555309	Jared	Dangerfield	4	73	211	\N	Dangerfield is proud of his football accomplishments, but even more proud of his late father, who was among the first responders at the World Trade Center on 9/11. David Dangerfield passed away from a heart attack in 2009, but would be equally proud of his son for his efforts on the gridiron. It didn't take long for the younger Dangerfield (6-3, 200) to adjust to the Hilltoppers' offense as a transfer from Fort Scott Community College; he was voted second-team All-Conference USA after grabbing 69 passes for 825 yards and 11 touchdowns. Dangerfield was a crucial part of the HIlltoppers' potent offense in 2015, as well, garnering honorable mention C-USA honors with 82 catches for 844 yards and eight scores.	Big and physical inside his routes. Uses a well placed push to free himself from grabby cornerbacks. Muscular legs allow him to drag tacklers for extra yardage after the catch. Decent footwork to free himself against press coverage. Can adjust to throws behind him and stretch and catch throws out in front. Has the size and aggressiveness to be effective blocker in run game. Consistent red-zone production for consecutive years.	Below average athleticism. Stiff route­-runner with dull feet and not much shake to get cornerbacks leaning. Missing the juice to free himself out of his breaks. Slow downfield and can't get over the top of cornerbacks. Focus drops were an issue this year with nine drops. Shows some balance issues in routes and after the catch.	\N	Big target with strength who benefited from an outstanding system opened opportunities for receivers. Dangerfield doesn't have the speed to threaten down the field or the separation quickness to open functional windows often enough. His size and blocking ability will be intriguing, but not sure he's athletic enough to earn a roster spot.	\N	444	4.83000000000000007	jared-dangerfield	\N
2555336	Robert	Nkemdiche	10	75	294	10.75	Nkemdiche (kim-DEECH-ee) presented elite athleticism and quick-twitch movement as the top defensive end prospect in the country coming into Oxford as part of the 2013 recruiting class. He's one of the more interesting prospects in the 2016 draft class, as well, because Georgia native never really had great statistical production despite his manifold pro-ready characteristics. He started 10 games for the Rebels in 2013, garnering Freshman All-American and Freshman All-SEC notice with eight tackles for loss and two sacks on the year. In Nkemdiche's sophomore year, he received second-team All-American honors from several media outlets despite making just four tackles for loss and two sacks in 13 starts. His junior year realized similar results, again being named second team All-American with statistics half as impressive as most others named to the team (seven TFL, three sacks). Nkemdiche's career at Ole Miss ended on a sour note, however, as he was arrested for marijuana possession after taking a fall from an Atlanta area hotel room. He was suspended from the team's bowl game after the incident, and decided to leave for the National Football League.	Exceptional build. Carries no bad weight and has outstanding thickness and power through his rear, thighs and calves. Plus movement skills and runs like a defensive end. Has reactive explosiveness for expanded range as tackler near line of scrimmage. Wrap up finisher who won't allow running backs out of his grasp. Plays with good lateral quickness and can win the race across the face of blockers. Played stronger at point of attack this year. Proved he could penetrate and 2-gap. Showed noticeable improvement as pass rusher this season. Has a decent spin move as pass rusher and plays with the power to force his way through a guard's shoulder and into the backfield. Improved quarterback pressures from 13 to 26 this year.	For all the talent and athletic traits, his production was disappointing. Produced low tackle totals and just 6.5 sacks over three years. Never forced or recovered a fumble. Ducks head into initial off snap losing track of the ball. Tightly ­wound, straight-line athlete who needs play to stay inside his optimal area of movement. Inconsistent effort after his initial pass rush move is thwarted. Needs to develop a counter rush move. Was suspended for Sugar Bowl after being arrested and charged with marijuana a possession. Scouting community has serious concerns about his personal character and work ethic.	Sharrif Floyd	Considered the top­-rated prospect in the nation when he signed with Ole Miss, the 3-­technique tackle is considered one of the key cogs in turning around the Ole Miss program. His talent and frame are worthy of an early selection, but his lack of high-­end production and character concerns could cause him to slide. With that said, he has the talent to be an impact starter in the league.	"Body beautiful and from the Shawn Oakman school of production. He's a much better talent than Oakman, but Oakman is the better kid. He will not be on our board as a first-round option.

2555310	Jaylon	Smith	13	74	223	9.5	Heading into the Fiesta Bowl, Smith was considered one of the best defenders in the country and a sure-fire elite prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft. He tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee during the team?s loss to Ohio State, however, placing some doubt on whether he would apply for early entry. The 2015 consensus All-American decided he had done enough in his college career, however, deciding to put his name in the hat despite the intense rehabilitation ahead of him. Smith became the second player to win both the high school and college Butkus Awards as the nation?s top linebacker, joining former Notre Dame star Manti Te'o, by leading the Irish with 113 tackles, nine of which went for losses. It was the second straight season Smith topped the defensive stats chart in tackles (112) and made nine TFLs. In his first year on campus, Smith started all 13 games, making 67 stops, 6.5 for loss. It is expected that Smith will bounce back from his knee surgery to become the athletic, explosive defender that wowed scouts over the past three years.	Angular, sinewy build with a body fat number you could count on one hand. Checks every size, weight, speed and athleticism box there is. Can sink hips and change direction with suddenness in space. Has length and quickness for extended playmaking radius. Racked up 225 tackles over his last two seasons as a starter. Lightning quick lateral scrapes from gap to gap following track of the ball. Able to transition from scrape to spring seamlessly. Has a turbo boost to race running backs to the corner. Tries to meet oncoming blocks with physical punch and desired arm extension to stay clean. Adequate speed to diagnose and respond. Play speed is elite for the position. Very talented in man coverage. Asked to take on challenging man coverage responsibilities and responded. Has tools to become an excellent blitzer.	Tackles for loss production doesn't match up with his traits. Too passive in his approach preferring to wait on plays rather than racing downhill to own them. Not strong enough at point of attack to maintain balance and positioning when blockers get into his frame. Understands angles to the ball, but still learning shortcuts through the gaps. Flies after the ball with reckless abandon failing to come to balance as a tackler. Has habit of lunging into arm tackles rather than using feet to work into better tackling position. Missed 11 tackles this year. Tore ACL and MCL in his bowl game and his rookie season is in doubt.	Derrick Johnson	In this day and age of "tweeners" being labeled "hybrid" players, Smith is the rare commodity who is truly hybrid in the sense that he has the athleticism, speed and physical makeup to play any linebacker spot in either the 3­-4 or the 4-­3. Smith was productive but slightly miscast in the middle of the Notre Dame defense and is better suited to play in space as a 4­-3 outside linebacker. However, his length and upfield burst could draw the attention of a 3-­4 team looking to transition him into a rush linebacker while utilizing his rare cover skills.

Even in a year in which the Gamecocks struggled to move the ball through the air (they ranked in the bottom quarter of the FBS), he set career highs with 28 catches for 421 yards and three touchdowns. The former star high school basketball player has the physical skills to excel as a receiver and blocker in the NFL.	Plays with good foot quickness inside his routes. Able to go up top and snare high throws with his long arms. Has the play speed and vertical feel to attack the seam and split Cover 2 safeties. Competes hard after the catch as a runner using jukes and spin moves to elude tacklers. Averaged 6.9 yards after catch. Looks spindly on the hoof, but buys into his role as a blocker. Can lock on and sustain a block longer than expected and was used in pass pro. Good teammate and well­-liked in the locker room.	Has decent straight line speed but isn't overly athletic. Upright into his routes and doesn?t offer much bend in and out of his breaks. Doesn't show much acceleration for separation out of his cuts. Hands are a little stiff and will fight some throws. Limited flexibility and unable to consistently adjust to poorly thrown balls. Off­-target throws stay off-­target.	Tyler Kroft	Tall and lanky for a tight end, Adams actually has better play strength than the eye­ test might indicate. Adams doesn't have the surest hands in this draft, but he is unique in that he can challenge defenses down the field and shows the potential to be helpful as a run blocker. Adams should come in as a quality backup with an "eventual starter" tag tied to him.	\N	85	5.34999999999999964	jerell-adams	\N
2555312	Noah	Spence	9	74	251	10.75	Spence's talent is unquestioned, but his judgement off the field will be foremost on the minds of NFL scouts as they evaluate him for the 2016 draft. A first-team All-Big Ten pick for Ohio State in 2013 as a sophomore, Spence ran into trouble for failing two drug tests. After being permanently banned from the Big Ten for the failed test, he underwent treatment for an addiction to Ecstasy. Instead of leaving for the 2015 draft, Spence decided to transfer to Eastern Kentucky to get his degree and to prove to himself and scouts that he had matured. It appears he made the right choice, racking up 22.5 tackles for loss, with 13.5 sacks for the Colonels to become a AP FCS All-American. At his size, Spence could play end or linebacker in the NFL, giving him a chance to succeed wherever he winds up -- if his life off the field is in order.	Plays with a big motor and tremendous endurance. Had eight-sack season as a sophomore at Ohio State. Plays at same speed throughout the game. Good upfield burst. Has played with hand in the ground and standing. Won't give away leverage by engaging too early in pass rush. Has solid speed to the edge with a strong rip move at the top of his rush to turn the corner. Takes good angles around the rush arc. Quick lateral slide down the line to restrict running lanes. Plays with a sense of desperation when the ball is in his area. Eludes lead blockers and cut ­blocks. Pursues around the field looking to scoop up tackles. Dominated his level of competition with 11.5 sacks, 22.5 tackles for loss and 63 tackles over 11 games. Scouts call him an intelligent person and player. Has had success fighting through adversity and has renewed sense of urgency on and off the field as well as a sense of accountability. Former head coach Urban Meyer helped get Spence a second chance because he believes Spence is high character but made mistakes.	Not as long or tall as teams like at defensive end. Needs to develop more strength at point of attack. Can be bumped of his grass and widened out against run. Average hand usage against the run. Doesn't play with violent punch and control at point of attack. Didn't vary pass rush approach much and just average with speed ­to ­power. Ability to win on high side will be countered by NFL tackles. Will have to develop a counter underneath. Good athlete, but not great twitch for sudden change of direction. At times is too easy to find for blockers. Treated for drug addiction and banned for life from Big Ten after failed drug tests in 2013 and 2014. Arrested in May of 2015 for alcohol intoxication and second­-degree disorderly conduct, but incident was expunged from record after community service.	Whitney Mercilus	His issues are well-­documented, but his recovery and turnaround is what has NFL teams excited. Spence has been accountable for his actions and worked just as hard off the field as he has on the field to change his life and attack his problems. His inability to hold the point of attack combined with his ability to rush the passer make him a logical choice as a 3-­4 rush linebacker. The speed of the game make take a year or two to get used to, but Spence should become a starter early in his career.	\N	199	6.11000000000000032	noah-spence	\N
2555313	Juston	Burris	14	72	212	8.875	Burris has been an excellent performer, physical and reliable, since his redshirt freshman season for the Wolfpack. The defensive back made five starts at the nickel spot that first year, playing in every game and intercepting three passes on the year (also with 43 tackles, eight pass break-ups.) In year two, Burris became a full-time starter (53 tackles, interception, 11 PBU). His stats dropped a bit in his junior year (29 tackles, one INT, five PBU) but rebounded a bit in 2015 (38 tackles, three TFL, one INT, seven PBU).	Good size and weight for a cornerback. Allowed just 34.1 percent completion rate with eight passes defensed. Played press and off man. Plays with smooth backpedal and good route recognition. Has the twitch to spring into action and attack at the catch point. Uses length as disruptive tactic from press. Fluid hips and shows ability to blanket underneath. Allowed just one touchdown in 44 targets. Competitor who doesn't back down from physical challenges. Steps downhill against the run and is willing to sacrifice his body to contain. Runs through blockers on his way to support the run and is a quality tackler with no broken tackles allowed all season.	Relies on his length and height on deep throws over long speed. Has a high center of gravity. Struggled to maintain his base and was knocked off balance from press against Clemson. Can be too quick to declare to outside and give away separation back inside. Long, overlapping strides in mirror technique make functional change of direction a challenge. Penalized six times this season including four pass interference calls.	Dwayne Gratz	Three-year starter who brings size and a competitive nature with him. Burris showed improvement as a cover corner this season and his ability to maintain feel and shadow receivers from press was evident. While he only logged three interceptions over his last three seasons, Burris consistently attacked throws and was just a hair away from about four more passes defensed. His traits and ball skills make him a corner to keep an eye on in the all­-star games.	\N	6	5.41999999999999993	juston-burris	\N
2555337	Shon	Coleman	7	77	307	10.625	Many prospects in this draft class have faced adversity, but few have looked cancer in the eye and beaten it. In the spring of 2010, Coleman was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Over the next two-plus years, the top 10 offensive tackle national recruit worked at St. Jude?s Children?s Hospital (located in his hometown of Memphis) to treat and defeat the disease. Coleman was finally cleared to play in the spring of 2012 and redshirted in the fall to get back into football shape. The following year he completed the comeback by playing six games as the backup to 2014 NFL Draft No. 2 overall selection Greg Robinson at left tackle. The past two seasons, Coleman has held down the blind side spot, starting every game and receiving second team All-SEC honors from league coaches. Casual college football fans and NFL scouts alike can see his frame and excellent length and agility, but should be more impressed by the mental toughness he?s shown over the past few years.	Very long and gets maximizing disruption from arm length. Above average play strength with powerful upper body. Extremely physical with backpack full of nasty with him. Drive blocker who uproots defenders and creates space. Latches onto defenders with big, strong hands. Gets chippy as run blocker and looks for aggressive finish. Pass sets are generally balanced with decent slide to the edge and ready hands. Has ability to redirect inside against stunts. Very heavy hands. Uses his punch as a measure of force and intimidation. Fires his hands from inside his frame and lands with proper placement. Able to play in space. Relatively smooth climbs to second level and mirrors oncoming traffic looking to engage. Has played on left and right side. Held his own against Myles Garrett from Texas A&amp;M losing badly just once on inside spin move.	Base will get too wide hindering balance. Leans into contact in pass sets and consistently plays with weight too far forward. Feet deaden when punching, opening door around the corner. Inconsistent footwork in general. Lunges at rushers trying to turn corner rather than sliding feet into position. Has habit of leading with head down and will miss run targets at times. Got away with holding in college. Doesn't bring feet thru contact in run game and has trouble sustaining without mauling. Needs hands to control defender rather than just punish. Will turn 25 as a rookie after sitting out two years overcoming a leukemia diagnosis in 2010.	Ereck Flowers	Coleman's strengths and weaknesses are strikingly similar to those of former Auburn left tackle Greg Robinson, but Coleman lacks the same level of athleticism. Coleman uses his length and redirect strength to overcome some of his lunging and waist-­bending, but those issues will be highlighted against NFL edge rushers. Coleman is a long, talented run blocker who could garner early round attention at either tackle position if NFL teams are okay with their deep dive into his medicals.	\N	90	5.83999999999999986	shon-coleman	\N
2555314	Mike	Rose	9	74	281	\N	One of the more under-appreciated players outside of the Carolinas, Rose received well-deserved consensus second team All-ACC honors in 2015. He started every game for the Wolfpack, making 51 tackles, leading the squad with 15 tackles for loss, 10.5 sacks, and forcing two fumbles for the second straight year. Rose had led the team in tackles for loss with 15 in 2014 (46 stops overall), as well, racking up five sacks in the process. As a part-time starter (four games in the middle of the year) as a sophomore, Rose had four TFLs and two sacks. He made an impact as a redshirt freshman on special teams, blocking a punt against Florida State that led to the game-winning touchdown in the team's upset win over the Seminoles.	Big, power end who isn't easily moved. Forced two fumbles, recovered one and applied 37 pressures as a pass rusher this year. Uses aggressive, powerful swipes to bat a tackle's punch away and soften the edge to turn the corner. Hustle player who keeps playing and migrating towards the ball.	Operates with slow twitch and is easy to find for blockers. Plays with rolling, rounded movements rather than sudden, crisp actions. Has pad level issues when moving vertically or twisting and gets knocked off course. Doesn't come off the snap with enough quickness or fire. Takes entirely too long to disengage and get after the play.	\N	Has good size for a base end, but simply doesn't possess enough functional athleticism to become an NFL pass rusher or a plus run stopper. Rose may need to add more weight to his frame and give it a go at an interior spot.	\N	6	4.74000000000000021	mike-rose	\N
2555315	Miles	Killebrew	17	74	217	9.5	It?s easy to mistake Killebrew for a linebacker, both because of his physique but also due to his hard hits. The four-year starter earned All-Big Sky recognition in each season: honorable mention in 2012 and 2013, second team in 2014, and first team in 2015. Killebrew reached the triple-digit mark in tackles the past two seasons (101 in 2014, 132 in 2015) and also showed an ability to handle his pass coverage responsibilities each year (three interceptions, one for a touchdown in 2014, seven pass break-ups in 2015). Killebrew was also named second team All-Big Sky last year after blocking two kicks. Special teams acumen and defensive productivity should earn him similar grades to FCS star safety Jaquiski Tartt (Samford), who was picked in the third round of the 2015 draft.	Tightly bundled muscle hammer with a compact frame and the thighs of a track sprinter. World-class form tackler with bad intentions behind his strikes. Patient and willing to wait until he's in proper range before exploding with everything he has into his victim. Confident around the line of scrimmage and uses aggressive hands to keep himself clean. Will not flinch in the face of contact and has the frame to be considered as a hybrid linebacker on the pro level. Relied upon to line secondary up and get defense situated.	Instincts are very average. Needs to see it first and then can be a step slow to respond. Doesn't anticipate run direction as well as he needs to. Lack of instincts hinders range in coverage. Has a tendency to eyeball quarterback and lose track of route development around him. Has a verified 4.43 time from the spring in the 40-yard dash, but play speed doesn't always match that. Could be limited to box duties.	Deone Bucannon	Violent player who looks to punish and intimidate with the force of his strikes, but who won't compromise his form as a tackler just for the highlight reel hit. Killebrew is average in coverage, but has the size and physicality that makes him stand out in the box. With the success of Arizona's Deone Bucannon as a hybrid linebacker, it is reasonable to assume that a team will look to Killebrew to fill that role for its defense. If he blows up the combine, he won't get past the second day of the draft.	\N	380	5.66999999999999993	miles-killebrew	\N
2555316	Paxton	Lynch	1	79	244	10.25	Lynch was lost a bit in the recruiting process after sitting out half of his senior season due to a knee injury suffered in the preseason, allowing Memphis head coach Justin Fuente to nab the Florida product from the under the noses of in-state schools. He redshirted his first year on campus, but then stepped in to become a three-year starter for Fuente. Lynch went through some ups and downs in his first year as a starter, throwing nine touchdowns against 10 interceptions and completing just 58 percent of his passes for about 2,000 yards in 2013. He improved greatly as a sophomore, leading his team to a 10-win season and American Athletic Conference championship. He received second team All-AAC honors that season by completing 63 percent of his passes for 3,031 yards and 22 scores. Lynch exploded onto the national scene during his junior year, garnering a Manning Award finalist nod, first team All-ACC honors, and team MVP after leading the Tigers to an 8-0 start before the team struggled down the stretch losing to Navy, Houston, and Temple. During the team?s hot streak, Lynch beat SEC foe Ole Miss with a 39-for-53, 386-yard, three-touchdown performance. But the next time he faced a SEC defense, Auburn took him to task in the Birmingham Bowl, forcing him to complete just 16 of 37 pass attempts for a measly 106 yards and an interception. Despite finishing the season on a down note, the departure of Fuente for Virginia Tech and positive accolades received from the NFL scouting community led Lynch to take his talents to the next level.	Very tall, athletic body with ability to scan over the top. Elite foot quickness for a tall quarterback. Can maneuver quickly out of a busy pocket and away from trouble, but desires to keep passing option alive. Sets up in the pocket quickly and generally keeps feet "throw ready". More functional scrambler than "tuck and run" quarterback. Sacked just 15 times over 477 drop backs. Able to win with his feet when he needs to. Has a quick release to overcome his slight wind­-up. Has enough arm to drive the ball into restricted windows. Has enough arm to attack downfield while on the move. Makes good decisions. Rarely takes the cheese when cornerbacks try and bait him. Displays qualities of a field leader and isn't easy to rattle. Yards per attempt have exploded over his last two years. Can gain chunk yards as zone-read quarterback and will appeal to boot­-action teams. Will be challenging to defend in the red area. Took better care of the football cutting turnovers down from 16 last season to just four this year. Completed 54.6 percent on intermediate throws (11­20) and 44.9 percent on deep balls (21-plus yards) including 19 touchdowns and just two interceptions.	Needs to improve ball placement for catch­-and­-run throws. Inability to throw with desired accuracy on the move forced him to leave yards and plays on the field. Must learn to better anticipate routes and stay ahead in the rep. Doesn't quite have the quickness through progressions that he will need in the pros. Has to learn to move defenders around with his eyes to open throwing lanes. At times, crowds targets against the sideline. Needs to stop babying play-­action passes and cut them loose. Consistency of arm strength has been overstated. Inconsistent weight transfer in delivery forces him to muscle some throws. Perimeter throws lack velocity and will nose­dive on him. His ball comes out with wobble and isn?t always the most catchable. Touch throws over inside linebackers needs work.	Marcus Mariota	While the hype around "dual threat" quarterbacks has subsided, Lynch possesses the size and athleticism to make NFL teams take a second look. Unlike other size/speed quarterbacks like Vince Young and Colin Kaepernick, Lynch prefers to extend passing plays with his feet rather than bolting from the pocket, but he is still likely to make plenty of plays with his feet over the long haul. Lynch shows the ability to read defenses and make smart decisions, but not yet at an NFL starting level. While he has the physical tools to start right away, a team who is willing to allow him to sit and study his craft for a year could reap maximum rewards in the future.	\N	60	6.16999999999999993	paxton-lynch	\N
2555317	Tajae	Sharpe	4	74	194	8.375	This tall, lean receiver presents problems for defenses on short, intermediate, and deep routes. The two-time first-team All-MAC pick caught 85 passes for 1,281 yards and seven touchdowns in his junior year, setting up big expectations for 2015. He exceeded those expectations, winning second team All-American honors from the Walter Camp Foundation by leading the nation with 9.3 receptions per game (total of 111) and ranking sixth in yards per game (109.9-yard average). Sharpe also finished his career catching a pass in every game he played for the Minutemen.	Has staccato footwork that works in his favor. Able to shake press coverage and get into routes quickly. Gets to top speed quickly. Plus route-­runner with athleticism to sink hips and break routes off sharply. Can stutter, shift and sell complex routes to create doubt in cornerbacks. Worked outside and from slot and hit on almost the entire route tree. Reliable target who drew double teams. Scouts love his humble personality and eagerness to take coaching and get better. Supple hands are automatic when he has room to catch it. Has improved football IQ under current head coach and former NFL coach, Mark Whipple.	Narrow frame needs more muscle and overall play strength. Without a clean release, can be slowed or completely redirected by press. Average in contested catch situations. Needs to get better at using body effectively to shield the catch and create space. Long speed not overly threatening. Can't break tackles to maximize run after catch potential.	Devin Street	Sharpe is the most productive receiver to come out of UMass, and as a receiver who turned 21 in December, it is conceivable that he could still be filling out his long frame. Sharpe has the athleticism, hands and feel for space to work from the slot and the size and route acumen to work outside. It might take a year, but he has the talent and football character to become a productive NFL receiver.	"I'll bet he steals the show in Shrine Game practices because he's got such great hands and he's so meticulous with his routes.

2555318	Trevon	Coley	10	72	305	\N	\N	Team captain who is generally quiet, but who became a more vocal leader in 2015. Named team MVP. Coaches praise him for his practice habits and energy. Outstanding tackle production with 118 over the last two seasons. Good play quickness off the snap and intensity cranks up when he senses an opening through a gap. Able to fight through redirect blocks once he gets into a blocker's edge. Active pass rusher.	Short, puffed up frame. Came in as a 235 linebacker and has stacked weight onto his frame. Doesn't have the length or frame to hold up when game comes downhill at him. Must live in the gaps or big offensive linemen can overtake him. Needs to win early in pass rush or his momentum fizzles out.	\N	Durable and productive over his four­-year span as a starter, Coley is considered to be the best defensive lineman to play at Florida Atlantic. While he's got decent play strength, solid hand usage and the desired motor, his smallish stature will be tough to overlook for teams during the draft. With that said, he's a good football player and will get his shot in a camp.	\N	211	4.90000000000000036	trevon-coley	\N
2555319	Darien	Harris	13	72	220	\N	The son of a former Virginia Tech running back, Harris decided to take his talents to the other side of the ball. After two years as a special teams ace, head coach Mark D'Antonio plugged Harris in at the Star linebacker spot in 2014 (48 tackles, 3.5 for loss, interception, two forced fumbles). Harris returned there in a third team All-Big Ten senior year (coaches, honorable mention by media), overcoming a lack of bulk with quickness and tenacious hitting. He racked up 90 tackles, nine for loss, and three pass deflections as a senior, finishing strong with 17 stops, 3.5 for loss, between the Big Ten Championship Game win over Iowa and the loss to Alabama in the Cotton Bowl.	Plays with good football intelligence and plus instincts. Diagnoses play quickly and races to get to his spot. Good play speed and is willing to take shots downhill into the gaps from the backside. Used in man coverage and has some basic cover skills. Has good downhill quickness and gets his body into the fray. Shows ability to anticipate play direction and play type.	Small and skinny for even a weak-side linebacker spot. Has very little play strength and needs a posse to come help tackle at times. Has to work too hard to disengage from blocking wide receivers. Downhill charge gets stopped dead in its tracks if he doesn?t find a gap. Change of direction is just average for a smaller, athletic player.	\N	Undersized WILL linebacker who can run and chase around the field and who has plus football intelligence and instincts. Harris has just one year of impressive tackle production, but he doesn?t have thump behind his pads and his play strength is below the NFL minimum. Harris may need to try and bulk up to give himself the best shot to make a team, but a practice squad seems like it should be his goal.	\N	34	5.09999999999999964	darien-harris	\N
2555320	Aaron	Wallace	13	75	240	\N	Wallace didn't get to experience a lot of his father's professional career, as the former Oakland Raiders' second-round pick left his job as an NFL linebacker when his son was only five years old. However, the younger Aaron obviously carries the family athleticism genes -- though he didn't really get to show his wares until his senior year with the Bruins. His senior year of high school was disappointing, as he couldn?t play due to torn ankle ligaments. After a redshirt year at UCLA, he played in 23 games as a reserve in 2012 and 2013, totaling eight tackles. Wallace saw the field a bit more regularly as a junior, starting one contest and making 19 tackles. He didn't earn a starting job coming out of fall camp in 2015, but injuries in the linebacker corps gave him a chance, and he took advantage. Wallace garnered honorable mention All-Pac-12 credentials, making 65 stops, 12.5 for loss and seven sacks on the year, getting on NFL scouts? radars.	Well­-built with good muscular definition. Slightly pigeon-toed with explosive burst upfield to threaten tackles. Quick-­twitch athlete. Plus lateral quickness and good knee bend in his play. Has enough juice to be a true edge rusher. Can dip and trim the corner with a tight turn. Finished this season with seven sacks and 17 pressures despite playing less than 60 percent of the snaps. Holds a solid edge against tackles and has the strength and potential to own tight ends at point of attack. Shows agility in space to cover. Has experience as 3­-4 rush linebacker and 4­-3 WILL and SAM. Showed massive improvement over the course of the season. Was playing his best football at the end of the year.	One-year starter. His play is more thinking than reacting at this time. Lacks experience and instincts to cut it loose and play at full throttle. Needs to play fast all the time. Can learn to strike with more authority as a tackler. Will get fooled by play­-action and can be slow to find the ball after the mesh ­point. Technique needs work taking on split zone blockers and pulling guards. In need of more violent punch and shed approach to disengage. Must improve at leveraging his gap from 4­-3 looks.	\N	Wallace is an ascending prospect with the twitch, athleticism and power to become an eventual starter as a 3­-4 outside linebacker. However, despite his growth as a player this season, he is still in a developmental phase and may take some seasoning before he is ready to become a contributor on the NFL level.	"Completely different player from the BYU game to the USC game. He has some talent but he's like a sophomore in terms of his linebacker instincts.

2555321	Antonio	Longino	12	74	221	\N	Like many NFL draft prospects, Longino grew up in a tough atmosphere for success. His East Cleveland neighborhood was rough, and his seven older brothers were caught up in the mix, some spending time in jail. His prowess on the football field earned him a trip to Hutchinson Community College, where he redshirted one season and showed enough talent (56 tackles, six for loss, in seven games) to be a top junior college recruit for the 2013 season. That year he was a reserve linebacker and special teamer (six tackles in eight games), but snapped up a starting role as a junior in 2013. His 17-tackle performance in the Sun Bowl that year (he had 94 for the year, 5.5 for loss) portended an outstanding senior year. Longino won the team's Defensive MVP award, as well as honorable mention All-Pac-12 recognition from league coaches (second-team All-Pac-12 from media) by leading the squad with 22.5 tackles for loss and 11 sacks. He tied for the top TFL per game mark in the FBS with 1.7.	Extremely active even after being blocked initially. Plays with hustle and works until the whistle blows. Productive 2015 with 11 sacks and 22.5 stuffs to go with two forced fumbles. Has a decent spin move in his rush game. Blitzed and stunted from all along the defensive front and has a talent for timing snaps.	Play strength on the edge is below the NFL minimum. Unable to hold up at the point of attack. Found himself being driven off the line of scrimmage to open massive rushing lanes. Mechanical mover without sudden, athletic twitch. Lacking a quality, upfield burst. Poor job of controlling point of attack with a strong punch. Allows blockers into his frame.	\N	While the stats look promising, the tape reveals a player who benefited a great deal from the Sun Devils' twisting, blitzing, stunting scheme. Longino is a rush ­end only who is not strong enough at the point of attack to play on the strong ­side or talented enough as a pass rusher to play on the open side. Should find himself in a camp, but could struggle to make a roster.	\N	45	4.88999999999999968	antonio-longino	\N
2555322	Darron	Lee	13	73	232	9.75	Lee's never been short on confidence, proclaiming to teammates that he was the one to take over for 2014 first-round pick Ryan Shazier in the Buckeyes' defense -- even though he was only a year removed from starring as a quarterback and cornerback in high school. He wound up starting all 15 games in that redshirt freshman year for the national champion Buckeyes, earning multiple Freshman All-American accolades with 81 tackles, 16.5 tackles for loss and 7.5 sacks. Lee truly hit the national stage by terrorizing Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, receiving Defensive MVP honors with seven tackles, three for loss, and two sacks. His play as a sophomore was just as good, tracking down ball carriers 66 times, 11 for a loss and 4.5 sacks on his way to second-team All-Big Ten accolades from league coaches (third team media).	Quick to diagnose and flow to the ball. Has unusual ability to find the most efficient routes to the ball. Has athleticism and flexibility to contort his body and succeed through difficult tackle angles. Plays with loose hips, quick feet and desired agility of an NFL weak-side linebacker. Former high school quarterback with the change of direction and speed to be a rangy playmaker. Comfortable in space and excels there. Has plus man cover talent. Willing to stand in and take on blockers with a leveraged strike if his gap is being threatened. Capable gap blitzer with ability to get skinny through the holes.	Smallish linebacker. Play strength doesn't come close to matching puffed up listed weight. Balance issues at point of attack could plague him over his NFL career. Has the body type of a big safety. Tape shows few authoritative tackles. Involved in too many arm and shoestring tackles. Comes flying in and fails to come to balance at times. Charged with 21 missed and five broken tackles over the last two seasons. Always at size disadvantage and will have to learn to slip more blocks. Can get better at finding targets in zone coverage.	Zach Brown	Lee's level of NFL success might very well be tied to scheme fit and his ability to add more muscle to his frame. His athletic traits and ability to make plays should make him a starter, but he won't unlock his full potential unless he gets strong enough to handle the rigors of an NFL linebacker.	\N	37	6.07000000000000028	darron-lee	\N
2555338	Kevin	Dodd	9	77	277	\N	Dodd was not as highly-touted as fellow defensive end Shaq Lawson coming into the 2015 season, but by the end of the year he was just as respected. The South Carolina native went to Hargrave Military Academy for the 2011 season before arriving in Clemson, and spent three years as a reserve (six tackles in eight games in 2012, seven tackles in four games in 2013, eight tackles, 2.5 for loss in 12 games in 2014) behind the Tigers? ever-talented defensive line before getting into the starting line-up on the strong side across from Lawson. Dodd's ascension was set back a bit by a knee injury in the 2013 season, but his play the following fall portended an excellent redshirt junior year. Dodd finished just behind his All-American teammate in tackles for loss (23.5) and sacks (12), receiving honorable mention all-conference notice from ACC coaches for his efforts. Those coaches might have voted him first team after the national championship game, however, as he lit up the Crimson Tide with five tackles for loss, including three sacks.	Relentless competitor with NFL-­ready frame. Refuses to give offensive lineman a play off. Not content to be around a play, wants in the action. Won't lay on blocks and able to improve his position after contact through footwork and strength. Never drops eyes from ball location and is able to unhinge from blocks quickly to make a play when the ball enters his patch of grass. Extremely instinctive and well-coached. Snuffs out screens, bootlegs and shovel passes almost every game. Takes his contain responsibility very seriously. Insane production spike from last year to this season. Saw his quarterback pressures go from three to 46 and he was credited with 12 sacks in 2015 season. Athletic upfield burst with desired bend and hip flexion to corner the edge. Has length and leverage to become an effective speed-­to­-power rusher. Wore Alabama out with three sacks and two tackles for loss. Tape shows a player who played his best football at the end of the year.	Has just one year of full-­time experience under his belt and was able to feast on some lesser tackles. Hand usage is still a work in progress. Too willing to take on blocks with a lowered helmet or allowing blocks into his frame rather than controlling the rep with his natural hand strength. Uses same hand swipe at the top of his rush and would benefit from greater diversity of approach. Still learning to consistently unlock his top play speed. Gets in a hurry to attack in space quarterbacks and running backs in space lunging after them rather than striking from balanced base.	Michael Bennett	The arrow is pointed up for Dodd who finished the season with a streak of five consecutive games with a sack. Dodd already looks the part of an NFL defensive end and his desire to make plays coupled with his physical traits and talent should have him shooting up draft boards. His lack of college snaps could preclude him from being "pro­ ready", but his instincts and football intelligence should expedite the learning process.	\N	1	6.33000000000000007	kevin-dodd	\N
2555323	Elijah	Shumate	15	72	216	9.75	Even though Shumate was one of the top recruits nationally in his class, it took an injury to Austin Collinsworth just prior to the 2014 season opener for Shumate to receive a starting spot. He showed enough flashes during his junior year, such as his 13-tackle performance against USC at the end of the regular season and big hits in the Music City Bowl, to have scouts quite interested in his potential. Shumate's senior year didn?t have a lot of big moments but he did start 12 of 13 games, making 70 tackles, 6.5 for loss, intercepting one pass and breaking up two others in a solid season for the Irish.	Has the desired build for a box safety. Physical, willing defender. Shows some straight line speed. Plays with good closing speed to the sideline against the run. Shows no hesitation to come down into the box and support the run. Clicks the accelerator and fires into his hits when he gets the chance. Has cover value on special teams.	Extremely rigid in his backpedal and plays with paralyzing hip stiffness when it is time to open up and cover against the deep ball. Man coverage is not his thing. Has blinders on and becomes too obsessed with his immediate responsibility rather than surveying the play. At times, comes in too hot and misses the tackle. Not very instinctive or natural with some of the angles he takes to the play.	\N	Box safety who was asked to play a more diverse safety spot for the Irish, but who lacks the instincts and athleticism to play in space on the next level. His size should get him a look, but he needs to improve his consistency as a tackler and show that he has cover value on kickoffs to help him make a roster.	"He will have to play near the line of scrimmage and would need to play zone only. I think he's a free agent." -- Midwest area scout	43	5.12000000000000011	elijah-shumate	\N
2555324	Joe	Bolden	12	75	231	\N	This senior captain brings toughness and instinctive play to every game. Bolden's play in the middle has been solid since he won Big Ten All-Freshman team accolades (31 tackles, four for loss) in his first year on campus. As a junior, he racked up 102 tackles, four for loss, and that followed that performance with an honorable mention All-Big Ten senior campaign. Bolden, a co-captain, led the Wolverines with 83 tackles last season, 6.5 for loss.	Productive tackler over the last two years including a 102-tackle season in 2014. Square scraper and keeps a close watch on the ball carrier. Flows to his run fit but reacts back inside if the running back cuts it back. Emotional leader on the team. Punches oncoming linemen from a position of leverage and gets hip roll and arm extension into his lick.	Short limbs and an average body type. Has stiffness in his lower body and doesn?t run with speed. Lacks reactive athleticism for functional movement on the NFL level. Allowed three broken tackles and 11 missed tackles in 2015. Body completely stalls out before responding on bootleg play­action. Attempts to mirror runner as he scrapes but lacks the acceleration to leverage against the sideline. Very slow in his drops into space.	\N	Lacks the size, speed and athleticism teams look for from NFL linebackers. A conversion to fullback might be worth a shot.	\N	33	4.59999999999999964	joe-bolden	\N
2555325	Jonathan	Jones	14	69	186	8.75	Although some NFL teams won't draft a cornerback under 5-10 because of the height and speed of today's star receivers, Jones' athleticism (110-meter hurdles national high school champion) and play the past two seasons will certainly make someone take a chance on his talent. He earned second-team All-SEC notice as a junior, ranking among the nation's leaders with six interceptions and 17 passes defended in his first year as a starter for the Tigers. He might have received the nod in 2013, but suffered a broken bone before the season and wasn?t quite up to the challenge physically. Jones started all 13 games as a senior, though, making 69 stops, intercepting one pass, and breaking up 13 others.	Has the foot quickness and fluid hips for smooth transitions from press coverage. Can open up and match quickness with quickness. Looks to make plays outside of his area. Former high school sprinter and hurdles champion. Able to carry long speed stride for stride. Man cover specialist with springy feet and ability to shadow his man. Usually near the throw. Has closing burst and ball skills to be aggressively disruptive at the catch point. Finds the deep ball and gets his head around to challenge. Finished 2014 with 16 passes defensed and six interceptions. Much better instincts underneath or in man coverage.	Miscast in zone and off coverage. Allows much cushion for pitch-­and­-catch throws. No getting around his lack of size. Beaten up by physicality of LSU in run support. Unable to unhinge quickly from big receivers and makes too many tackles down the field. Has endured a rash of injuries including a broken ankle in 2013, a pulled hamstring in the 2014 BCS Championship game and foot surgery in the summer of 2015.	\N	Jones had a very impressive All­-SEC 2014 season, but a relatively pedestrian 2015 campaign. Jones lacks the size to play outside but he does have coverage talent and ball skills to match up with quick slot receivers on the next level. His history of injuries and inconsistency in run support might put a limited ceiling on his draft positioning.	\N	90	5.25999999999999979	jonathan-jones	\N
2555326	Joshua	Perry	12	76	254	10.25	Perry gained respect from Big Ten coaches for his play as a senior, garnering first team All-Big Ten notice with 105 tackles, 7.5 for loss and three sacks. He also received honors for his leadership and character, being named an all-state AFCA All-Good Works Team member, as well as a finalist for the Lott IMPACT, Senior CLASS Award, and the Wuerffel Trophy. The Buckeyes' leading tackler in 2014 (124, 8.5 for loss, three sacks) earned honorable mention All-Big Ten honors in his second year as a starter (he had 64 tackles, two for loss the previous year). Though not a highly recruited player like many on head coach Urban Meyer's squad, Perry's list of national honors speaks volumes about his willingness to do what it takes to get the job done.	Noted leader on the field and in the locker room. Winner who is willing to do the dirty work. Big and physical and has the strength and grit to handle himself at point of attack. Productive tackler with good finishing rate. Wrap up tackler who throws his chest into it. Allowed just one broken tackle over last two years. Has old­-school thumper's mentality in the box. Well­-conditioned and continues to bring his lunch pail into the fourth quarter. Plays with good instincts anticipating screen passes and getting jumps on wide rushing plays.	Will play through a straw and has a limited area of impact as a playmaker. Gets too caught up in physical battles against blockers and loses sight of the ball. Plays too tall and allows blockers under his pads and into his frame. Needs to punch and shuck sooner and get to the tackle. Stiff movement in space and labors with direction change. Below average sideline­-to-­sideline chaser. Doesn?t appear to have the one-on­-one cover skills to stay on the field in sub­packages.	Taiwan Jones	Physical linebacker who has produced high­-end tackle numbers over the last two years at Ohio State. Perry played the role of thumper on a loaded Ohio State team, but may be lacking the athleticism and overall speed to replicate his college production in the pros. His best fit may be as a physical, 3-­4 inside linebacker who has to leave the field on passing downs.	\N	37	5.36000000000000032	joshua-perry	\N
2555359	Soma	Vainuku	3	71	246	9.5	The cousin of former USC star and Bengals linebacker Rey Maualuga brings his full effort on every play. Vainuku, who had 2,202 rushing yards as a high school senior, didn't have much for offensive statistics in 2015 (two carries for four yards, one score, no receptions). In fact, he never carried the ball more than 10 times in a season for the Trojans (24 total carries for 148 yards and three TD) and only contributed as a receiver in his redshirt freshman (8-50) and sophomore (9-74, 1 TD) seasons. But he did make his presence felt on special teams each season, making 13 tackles on coverage units in 2013 and 2015, and blocking three punts as a sophomore. Vainuku was named first team All-Pac-12 on special teams and the Trojans' Special Teams Player of the Year for his 2013 efforts, and garnered second team All-Pac-12 honors as a senior for his special teams acumen.	Wide frame. Runs well enough to get outside as a lead blocker. More athletic than expected for a big fullback. On cover teams, is able to change directions in space and chase return man with decent speed. Finished his USC tenure with 37 special teams tackles. Team­-first player. Father was a Rugby star in Tonga.	Had three 15-­yard penalties this year with limited amount of snaps. Must learn to play under control. Beaten out as Trojans' top option as lead blocker. Doesn't take control of defender's outside shoulder to secure the edge on outside flowing plays. Needs to play with more hip and knee bend to improve leverage at the point of attack. Hasn?t caught a pass in two years.	\N	While he has the desired size as a hammer­head lead blocker, he doesn?t consistently get blocks secured and his value in the passing game is very little. Vainuku's production on special teams will give him an outside shot to make a roster, but he has to prove to a team he can be a legitimate fullback option as it is unlikely that he will earn a spot as just a special teams ace.	\N	50	4.79999999999999982	soma-vainuku	\N
2555327	Kris	Frost	13	74	240	10.5	When Frost isn't flying around the football field, he's taking on the sky, working toward his pilot license as a Flight Management major at Auburn. Like any good pilot (and true to his name), Frost is cool, calm and collected as a defensive leader. Frost displayed a solid all-around game in his first year as a starter in 2014, moving well for his size in coverage (one interception, three pass breakups). He also served as an effective blitzer (10 tackles for loss, 3.5 sacks), slipped blocks between the tackles and hustled down plays from behind (85 total stops). Frost played well as a senior, too, making 96 stops, three for loss, and two interceptions. His inside-outside versatility will earn him a spot in the NFL.	Big frame with good height, weight and length. Large hands for a linebacker. Shows off natural power when taking on iso blockers with a heavy, forearm shiver. Has powerful explosion through hips but needs his pad level right to unlock them. Had four defensive coordinators during his time at Auburn and should benefit from scheme stability. Adequate lateral agility to slide and follow the ball. Active hands against the pass with eight passes defensed.	Was benched along with two other starters for poor performance and lack of communication in the 45­-21 loss to LSU. Gets lost on the field. Lacks awareness and instincts to keep him in front of the play. No feel for where blocks are coming from and gets sealed far too often by second level blockers. Needs to drop pad level. Missing the play speed and instincts to play downhill effectively. Content demeanor and lack of fire are a concern to scouts.	James­-Michael Johnson	Highly rated coming out of high school, but failed to live up to expectations. While the lack of defensive stability at the defensive coordinator spot during his years at Auburn should not be discounted, his lack of instincts made him a step slow to the play and allowed blockers to find him too easily. Frost has very good size and has a chance to rehabilitate his draft grade at the East-West Shrine Game and NFL Scouting Combine.	"I think his head is swimming from all of the voices he's had as coordinator. At some point he may start to play rather than think and he's got really good size. What is going to kill him is his effort level. His LSU tape was embarrassing." -- AFC Director of college scouting	90	5.15000000000000036	kris-frost	\N
2555328	Michael	Caputo	17	72	200	\N	This Junior ROTC member garnered second-team All-American honors in 2014 from the Football Writers Association of America after leading the team with 106 tackles and coming up big in big games. He racked up 15 stops against LSU in the season opener, and he made seven stops while breaking up two passes in the team's upset win over Auburn in the Outback Bowl. Caputo's senior year wasn't quite as productive as a tackler (65 stops, one for loss) but he did intercept two passes and break up eight others. Caputo suffered a concussion against Alabama seen by the entire nation, but returned to form for the next game and didn't miss a beat, garnering second team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight season.	Three-year starter and considered one of the toughest guys on the team. Well respected leader who works with young players. Quick to recognize play­-action and respond. Shows ball skills and aggressiveness at the catch point. Posted 17 passes defended over last two seasons. Comes downhill in run support looking for action. Takes solid angles to the ball and consistently gathers his feet before striking. Willing to play with pain.	Eyeballs the route from two­-deep coverage and misses out on hints from quarterback's eyes. Too slow to stick with man coverage. Always looking to chop down legs as a tackler rather than wrapping up driving through the hit. Ends up with too many arm tackle attempts. Had surgery in 2012 for a protruding disc in his spinal cord, and suffered a concussion against Alabama and had to leave the game.	\N	Safety who is best suited near the line of scrimmage and who is more than willing to step up and do his part against the run. Caputo is the type of durable leader that defensive coordinators will like and he has some special teams value, but his lack of speed and limitations in coverage could hurt his draft chances.	\N	40	4.95000000000000018	michael-caputo	\N
2555329	Myles	Jack	13	73	245	10.25	One of the most versatile players in college football the past three seasons, Jack earned a reputation as a dynamic defender and a contributor on offense. In fact, he earned both the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year award in 2013, as well as being named finalist for Paul Hornung Award as the nation?s most versatile player. A second-team All-Pac 12 defender as a freshman (75 tackles, two interception, 11 passes defended), he had seven rushing touchdowns on the year as well. Pac-12 coaches voted him second team all-conference again in 2014, as he made 88 tackles, eight for loss, intercepted one pass and broke up seven others. He also contributed as a runner, as well, carrying the rock 28 times for 113 yards and three scores. Jack?s junior year was stopped short by a knee injury three games in, though he looked like he was on the way to a fantastic season before the malady occurred (15 tackles, interception). Despite the injury, Jack announced he had "done enough" at UCLA and wanted to be compensated for his play -- so he declared for early entry in the 2016 NFL Draft. Considering that his mother insured Jack against injury after his freshman season, it's not surprising that economics won the day in Jack's decision.	Ultra athletic and can get to the rock from any position on the field. Former running back with speed to run down crossing routes and head off running backs exploding around the corner. Adequate instincts with above average reaction off the snap. Races downhill after the snap and can weave from gap to gap with blazing lateral quickness. Able to weave through and around traffic in relentless pursuit. Plays with desired pad level and leverage. Uses hip explosion to strike on the rise with a hammering blow at the point of attack. Can jar offensive linemen off­-balance with his strikes. Comes off of blocks quickly. Stepped in and was "the dude" from Day 1 at UCLA. Physical and active with alpha qualities on the field. Offers tremendous versatility for creative defensive coordinators. Has the juice to be an edge rusher in sub-­packages and can fit into any 4-­3 linebacker spot at any time. Has played safety and running back at UCLA. Has the strength, speed and athleticism to cover tight ends, running backs and some slot receivers. Plays with frenetic energy and is always looking to get his licks in.	Doesn't have prototypical linebacker frame. Lower body build is more like a running back and doesn't have ideal length. Will take some challenging routes to the football at times. His excitable brand of play will need more control in the pros. Suffered torn anterior meniscus that ended his season in late September. Medicals will likely determine draft stock.	NaVorro Bowman	Upper echelon explosiveness with the desire, speed and aggression to find his way into play after play. While UCLA asked Jack to do a little bit of everything, an NFL team is more likely to simplify his tasks and set him into attack mode to maximize his outstanding physical traits. If he bounces back from the knee injury, Jack could become a high-­end talent early on in his career.	"I wouldn't get cute with him. I would stick him at WILL and just let him be a free running chaser. He has the speed to get to everything and his cover talent will set him apart." -- NFC executive	52	7.5	myles-jack	\N
2555330	Brian	Poole	14	69	210	\N	Although his running mate on the outside, Vernon Hargreaves, gets most of the attention, Poole is no slouch. He was a five-star recruit ranked as high as number 25 overall in the nation coming out of Brandenton Southeast in 2012. He contributed as a freshman (three tackles in 12 games), then starting six games as a nickelback the following year (32 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions, three pass break-ups). Poole became a regular starter, both as a corner and nickel, in 2014, leading the Gators with four interceptions and finishing second on the team with 10 pass break-ups. Poole didn?t pick off a pass and started only six games as a senior at safety and nickel, but played every week and finished second on the team with 10 pass break-ups (along with 40 tackles, 3.5 for loss).	Plays with a high level of football intelligence and instincts. At his best in zone coverage. Reads quarterback and is quick to anticipate throws. Will drift beyond his zone if he believes he can help. Has 25 passes defensed over the last two seasons. Plays with solid ball skills. Willing to take chances and undercut throws to make up for his lack of size and length. Crowds receivers and contests catches. Plus route recognition and willing in run support.	Short cornerback who struggles to leap and defend high throws. Instincts get him ahead, but lacks the reactive quickness needed to be his best in the red zone. Tagged with seven touchdowns allowed over last two years. Play speed is very average. Would like to see more hustle in his pursuit from backside. Willing tackler but doesn't go out of his way looking for additional action. Sluggish transition quickness leads to lunging.	\N	If he were taller and a stronger tackler, I could easily see a transition to safety considering his instincts and ability to read quarterbacks and route progressions. While a team could try him there, my guess is that he will have to make it as a slot corner. His speed and quickness numbers at his workout will be extremely important for him.	\N	82	4.91999999999999993	brian-poole	\N
2555331	Cody	Core	4	75	205	10.375	A native of Auburn, Alabama and son of a former Troy State tight end (Thad), Core played mostly special teams, and even some defensive back, during his first two years in Oxford. But then the door opened for him as a receiver in 2014, and he took advantage (41-558, six touchdowns). Core's numbers didn't increase as a senior due to the return of Laquon Treadwell and quarterback Chad Kelly's ability to spread the ball around (37-644, four TD) but his big play ability (17.4 yards per catch in 2015) is obvious.	Good overall size. Pushes hard upfield to sell the deep ball and put defender in defensive posture. Good leaper who uses his size and spring to go up and get the ball. Strong enough to grind out yards after the catch with his size. Effective special teams cover man during his time at Ole Miss with 18 tackles. Able-bodied blocker.	Hands are just average. Allows ball into his frame and doesn't snatch it with strength. Not a sudden, athletic receiver and takes awhile to get into and out of his breaks. Below average acceleration. Runs rounded, sloppy routes and has issues adjusting them in space.	\N	Played his best football this season. Had his best output against Alabama and then in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma State. Core has desired size, but could struggle to find separation against NFL cornerbacks. If he can pick back up with the special teams coverage ability he showed at Ole Miss, he gives himself a better chance to stick around.	\N	93	4.90000000000000036	cody-core	\N
2555332	Connor	Cook	1	76	217	9.75	Cook was the most intriguing senior quarterback prospect heading into the 2015 season, and he did not disappoint in his final campaign. He had already secured a place among the best quarterbacks in MSU history, throwing for nearly 6,000 yards, and tossing 46 touchdowns versus 14 interceptions in his sophomore and junior years -- garnering second team All-Big Ten honors both seasons. In 2015, he captured the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and Big Ten Quarterback of the Year Award, leading the Spartans to a spot in the College Football Playoff by throwing for 3,131 yards and 24 touchdowns (throwing seven picks). Cook completed just 56 percent of his passes as a senior, however, down from 58.7 percent and 58.1 percent the previous two years. The Ohio native also fought off a shoulder injury, missing the win over Ohio State, but returning to help his team win their second Big Ten championship in three years. Cook won the MVP award in both the 2013 and 2015 Big Ten Championship Games.	Four-year starter who has shown consistent improvement and added new elements to his game each year. Can operate with a high level of confidence and efficiency. Worked under center and plays with good foot quickness in his drops. Shows good anticipation for developing windows and effective with timing routes. Will continue to scan and re-­scan thru targets when on the move. Reads safeties early and rarely takes shots downfield that safeties can get involved with. Comfortable operating on the move. Throws in rhythm and with accuracy when rolling right. Plus arm strength with compact, lightning quick release. Able to make big boy throws with pace into difficult, dangerous windows. Will stand in and take the hit to challenge man defender with a deep shot. Attacks edges of end zone with touch throws. Didn't shrink away from duties when asked to run the ball. More battle tested than any quarterback in this draft.	Habit of throwing short passes with too much pepper. Accuracy is a major concern. Often caught flat- footed in the pocket and appears willing to launch throws without proper balance or step to target. Open front hip causes him to spray outside frame of his intended target. Sees throws come open but won't always cut it loose. Can struggle mightily when forced off of his first option. Misses opportunities to adjust protection pre-­snap. Gets locked in on shotgun snap and misses signs of blitzers sneaking forward. First instinct versus blitz is to go up top rather than finding easier, short completion. Gives little effort to sell play­ fakes even on run downs. Scouts question his field demeanor and leadership in adverse times. Failed to rise to the occasion in 2015 Big Ten Championship Game or playoff game against Alabama.	Brian Hoyer	As a four-year starter, Cook has the big game experience and the production from a pro-­style attack that should warrant early consideration.The concern is that his short and intermediate accuracy has never shown the improvement and consistency that scouts expected to see. His inability to take over in big games this year could hurt his cause. Cook flashes the potential of an NFL starter, but he has the makeup of game manager over playmaker.	"He has all the pieces but he's never put the puzzle together. Coordinators and quarterback coaches always think they can fix those kinds of guys so they fight the hardest for them in the draft rooms I've been in." -- Former NFL GM	34	5.84999999999999964	connor-cook	\N
2555333	Corey	Coleman	4	71	194	\N	Coleman grew up in a tough Dallas neighborhood playing football in the streets, with a father who is currently serving prison time for felony cocaine distribution. But with the guidance and hard work of his mother, Cassandra Jones, as well as his godfather, former Baylor and NFL star defensive back Ray Crockett, Coleman fulfilled his potential as a playmaker at the college level. As a redshirt freshman, Coleman started 10 games in head coach Art Briles' offense, catching 35 passes for 527 yards and two scores, as well as averaging over 28 yards per kickoff return. His sophomore season started late, as he missed the first three games of the year with a hamstring injury, but finished strong. He was named second-team All-Big 12 (first team by the media) after covering 1,119 yards and scoring 11 times on just 64 receptions. Most importantly, Coleman came up big at the right times (15-224, TD vs Oklahoma, 7-150, TD vs Michigan in Cotton Bowl) ... but that was just a hint of things to come. Coleman won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation?s top receiver in 2015, along with unanimous All-American and first-team all-conference honors, leading the country with 20 touchdown receptions (74-1,363 receiving for the year). He missed the team's Russell Athletic Bowl win over North Carolina after having sports hernia surgery in December in order to be ready for the run up to the 2016 NFL Draft.	Instant blur off the snap. Feet turn over at a blinding pace and he devours cushion before cornerbacks know what hit them. Able to get over the top of every corner he faced and demands safety help over the top. Works back to the ball. Explosive leaper with ability to climb ladder and win the 50/50 ball and body control to secure the acrobatic catch. Touchdown maker finishing 2015 with 20 receiving touchdowns. Smooth, speedy stems to the post will be difficult to mirror and match for NFL cornerbacks. Easy route adjustments in space. Defenders who try to jam and miss pay the iron price (touchdowns). Able to make tacklers miss in tight spaces. Has experience as ball carrier and punt returner. Heavily targeted (39 percent) in Baylor's high­-flying attack.	Does his best work from outside the numbers, but lacks desired NFL size to play outside. Allows cornerbacks to leverage him against the sideline on deep throws. Takes longer than expected to gear down for comeback routes after hitting top speed. Ran limited number of simple routes. Hands are a concern. Fails to catch away from his body. Dropped 10 passes for a drop rate of 11.9 percent. Loses focus and concentration on routes that work towards the middle of the field or when he senses defenders are closing in. Had sports hernia surgery that forced him to miss his bowl game.	John Brown	Dangerous vertical talent with the ability to get over the top of defenders who fail to recognize his blazing quickness off the line of scrimmage. Coleman can get instant separation to create favorable passing windows and is one of the top playmakers in this draft. Coleman's issues with drops near the middle of the field could be a concern if teams see him next as a slot receiver due to his lack of size. Regardless, he can line up outside and win and he offers immediate punt return help.	\N	10	6.09999999999999964	corey-coleman	\N
2555334	Jared	Goff	1	76	215	\N	Instead of following the path of his father, Jerry, to major league baseball (played catcher for three teams over six seasons), Goff starred as a high school quarterback in the Bay Area. Cal coaches put him right into the fire in 2013, and he answered the challenge as the school's first-ever freshman opening weekend starting quarterback. The honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick (18 TD, 10 INT) set school records for passing yards (3,508), passes completed (320), and passes attempted (531) on a 1-11 team lacking great talent. He suffered an injury to his throwing shoulder in the "Big Game" against Stanford that year, but managed to return for the 2014 spring game. In fact, he started all 12 games as a sophomore, completing 62.1 percent of his passes for 3,973 yards and 35 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. Goff capped his career at Cal with a first team All-Pac-12 season, starting every game and setting conference records with 4,719 passing yards and 43 touchdowns on the year. The Bears also won their first bowl game since 2008 when Goff threw for 467 yards and six touchdowns when they took out Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl. Even before that victory, however, Goff decided to move on to the professional ranks after the season as one of the top quarterback prospects for the 2016 NFL Draft.	Quality arm. Makes all the throws and can sling the deep out with velocity and accuracy. Clean release and snaps throws off with flick of the wrist. Drives hips through his release for extra heat. Pocket mobility and poise showed improvement from 2014 to 2015. Maintains proper footwork and readiness to throw as he slides inside the pocket. Speeds up internal clock when he feels pressure or recognizes blitz. Pocket climber. Able to run out of trouble rather than into it. Looks the part of a confident, first round quarterback when working from a clean pocket. Sells his play ­fakes with purpose and draws linebackers forward. Has learned to expedite his throws from off­-balance angles due to pocket pressure. Will throw receivers open in tight quarters. Has excellent trajectory and pillowy soft touch on touch throws down the field that give receivers a chance to make plays. Showed substantial growth with his willingness to attack intermediate areas of the field and did so with accuracy and relative success. Completed an impressive 43.8 percent of his deep throws. Competes on third and long seeking out first downs over check downs.	Hits a rough patch with accuracy from time to time. Sails throws over intended targets especially early in games. Has spots where he makes receivers work too hard on easy throws. Spent 99.8 percent of his pass snaps from pistol or shotgun this season. Will likely need to orient himself with NFL footwork from under center. Rhythm passer who benefited from the up­tempo and "quick game" of Cal's Bear Raid offense. Has to learn fine line between getting ball out and rushing throws. Able to escape pocket, but isn't a proven finisher when on the move. Fumbled the ball 24 times over the last three years losing 11. Sacked 81 times over three years. Internal clock and poise will need to be monitored closely. Several of his interceptions came when he failed to read zone defenders underneath drifting up to challenge the throw.	Matt Ryan	While Goff is a little leaner in the lower body than teams might like, he has good size, an NFL arm, advanced pocket mobility and the field demeanor of a franchise quarterback. His accuracy and decision making will suffer from occasional lapses, but he displays the tools to become a good starting quarterback with time.	\N	47	6.55999999999999961	jared-goff	\N
2555335	Jonathan	Bullard	10	75	285	\N	The Gators have had a versatile defensive lineman selected in the first round in two of the last three drafts: Sharrif Floyd to Minnesota in 2013 and Dominique Easley by the Patriots in 2014. Bullard is looking to become the next in line. The former five-star recruit has moved between end and tackle during his career, showing off both quickness and power. He was fairly productive despite playing inside often as a junior (8.5 tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks), but really turned on the juice as a senior (66 tackles, 17.5 TFL, 6.5 sacks), earning third team All-American honors from the Associated Press as well as consensus first team All-SEC honors.	Quick and instinctive off the snap. Has a sense of where the ball is going and heads in that direction. Moves well down the line against zone plays. Uses hands and inside shoulder to brace against blocker to prevent a cross face block. Comes out of his stance with good pad level and burst. Attacks gaps and produces disruptive results. Half of his tackles gained two yards or less and was credited with 17.5 tackles for loss. Hard-charging, high-effort defender. Has above average change of direction talent for his size and a second gear in pursuit of ball carriers. Competitive and willing to mix it up. Had several physical reps against LSU and Vadal Alexander. Hands are solid, but can get better. Able to generate a bull rush and has potential to roll through guards with weak edges en route to the quarterback.	Leggy with duck­-footed gait. 'Tweener frame. Comes off the ball with good pad level but plays taller and taller as the play continues. Always in a hurry and is prone to overrun his fits against zone and get washed down. Doesn?t play with much quick-­twitch movement. Average explosiveness and suddenness means his pad level and technique have to be tightened up. Gets turned out of gaps by double teams. If his initial pass rush doesn?t create an advantage, he tends to sit on blocks and look to bat ball down.	Mario Edwards	Has the frame to add more functional strength and mass and may need to since his best fit appears to be as a 1­-gapping defensive tackle in an attacking scheme. Bullard can be a very disruptive player off the snap when his pad level is good and he?s an excellent tackler allowing no broken or missed tackles all season. Bullard will need to improve his pass rush and add necessary size, but he is an ascending talent whose game should continue to improve at the next level.	\N	82	6.08000000000000007	jonathan-bullard	\N
2555339	Kamalei	Correa	9	75	243	9.375	For three straight years, a member of the Boise State Broncos has left school early for the NFL Draft. Correa follows defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (picked by Dallas in the second round of the 2014 draft) and running back Jay Ajayi (fifth round, Miami, 2015). This year's early entrant is Correa, native of Honolulu, Hawai'i. He earned second-team All-Mountain West accolades in 2015, leading the Broncos with 11 tackles for loss and seven sacks on the year. Two of those sacks came in his last game with the Broncos, a win over Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl. Those numbers were actually down from Correa's sophomore year stats, when he was named first team all-conference after leading the Mountain West with 12 sacks and finishing third with 19 tackles for loss. In his true freshman year, 2013, he played in every game as a reserve (12 tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, sack).	Well­-built and twitched up. Has see ball, get ball traits to work with. Rarely fooled by back­side bootlegs or reverses. Unleashed his impressive long speed and pursuit motor to run down a Utah State running back 51 yards down the field. Tackle finisher when he launches into target. Logged 19 sacks and five forced fumbles over last two seasons. As pass rusher, has explosion potential to create some edge panic with NFL coaching. Has second gear to chase from sideline to sideline.	Seems to be more focused on getting out of the blocks quickly rather than gaining ground upfield as a rusher. Hand usage is inconsistent and unrefined. Doesn't use hands as weapons of victory often enough at the top of his rush. As NFL edge player, will have to play with more jolt and power in his punch. Play strength is just average. Lacks feel for down­ blocks and cracks and can be pinned down too easily. Will come flying to the ball at full ­speed and overrun the tackle.	Frank Zombo	Correa will likely transition into a full-time 3­-4 outside linebacker as a pro. While he doesn't have as much play strength as expected and is still raw as a pass rusher, NFL teams will be attracted by his quick-twitch athleticism and moldable traits as a pass rusher. The tape says Day 3 of the draft, but the upside could get him called earlier. He might require patience as there is still work to be done for Correa.	"I wanted to see more this year. It's frustrating watching him because you can see the potential, but he just doesn't unlock it as much as he should. Against that schedule he should have been more productive." -- NFC North scout	108	5.58999999999999986	kamalei-correa	\N
2555340	Kyler	Fackrell	13	77	245	10.125	A stand-up rush linebacker with length and agility, Fackrell came out the box strong for the Aggies, garnering all-conference honors in each of his first two seasons on campus (21 tackles for loss, eight sacks in 2012-2013). Fackrell suffered a torn ACL in the season opener as a junior but returned with in his final year, consistently making plays on the edge against the run (82 tackles) and attacking the backfield (15 tackles for loss, four sacks, two forced fumbles, five recovered). Scouts appreciate the maturity of a plyer who has gone through injury adversity, as well as taken on responsibilities via marriage and fatherhood. Fackrell and his wife, Elizabeth, welcomed a baby girl (Delaney) into the word early in 2015.	Premium length and athleticism. Played quarterback and wide receiver in high school and lettered in basketball and volleyball. Rangy tackler who is able to shadow the ball all over the field. Has length and arm extension to punch and control the point of attack. Functional strength is good enough against the run. Has length and motor for tremendous tackle radius. Had 80 tackles or more in each of his last three full seasons. Had just five sacks, but often dropped into space. Potential is there to become plus pass rusher. Combines forward lean, hip explosion and long arms to crank up speed-­to­-power pocket push. Upfield burst covers substantial ground in first three steps. Has upper body turn and shoulder dip to slip under tackle?s shoulder and around the corner. Don?t sleep on his cover ability in space.	Missed the entire 2014 season with an ACL tear. Can improve his hand play as pass rusher at the high side of his rush. When edge rush stalls out, has average counter attack. Long-strider who struggles to make sudden inside moves once he gets going upfield. High center of gravity combined with lean lower half make it difficult to play through redirect blocks with contact balance.	Connor Barwin	When it comes to the length and athleticism teams will look for off the edge, Fackrell will be one of the poster boys. His field versatility, coverage talent and potential as a pass rusher could make him one of the fastest rising prospects in this draft and a future contender for a Pro Bowl nod.	\N	73	5.94000000000000039	kyler-fackrell	\N
2555341	Hunter	Henry	5	77	250	9.25	Three years ago, the Razorbacks were delighted to have a legacy recruit in their backyard (Little Rock), who just happened to be one of the top tight end prospects in the country. His father, Mark, played offensive tackle for Arkansas from 1988 to 1991, serving as a team captain his senior year. Hunter didn't make it to his senior year, however, choosing to enter the 2016 NFL Draft after a spectacular junior season where he won the John Mackey Award as the nation?s top tight end and garnered consensus first team All-American honors. The first-team All-SEC pick by league coaches and media had 51 catches for 739 yards and three scores on the year. This production wasn?t out of the blue, given his recruiting status and production as a sophomore (37-513, two touchdowns receiving) and a true freshman in 2013 (28-409, four scores despite fighting issues in both knees).	Flat-­running stud as a run blocker and a big part of Arkansas' running game success. Strikes into the frame of defenders with inside hands and blocks with a wide, strong base. Able to turn outside linebackers and cornerbacks out of their run fits and sustains his blocks as long as he can. Had no drops and 51 catches this season. Able to secure contested catches and eminent hits won't scare him away from the catch. Able to work all three levels as a go-­to target. Too talented to be covered by most linebackers. Able to run a variety of routes and has no reason to leave the field.	Don't need much space for this section. Can get a little grabby as a run blocker and was penalized for three holding calls in 2015. Is a little upright into his breaks with rounded turns over sharp cuts. Is a little labored when adjusting his routes to traffic.	Jason Witten	By far, the premier tight end in the 2016 draft. Henry is a big body with the athleticism to get open, the hands to finish catches in traffic and the blocking ability to help give a running game the additional kick it might be missing on the edge. Henry should come in and become a very good NFL starter.	\N	89	6.5	hunter-henry	\N
2555342	Karl	Joseph	15	70	205	9.75	Ironically, Joseph's play style of a complete lack of respect for his own body was not the reason he missed more than half of his senior season. He injured his knee in a non-contact practice drill, putting a stop to his best year to date, where he led the FBS in interceptions (five) after four weeks. Joseph flies into the backfield and attacks receivers in space like few others in this draft class, as he showed during his first-team All-Big 12 junior campaign (92 stops, 4.5 for loss, one interception, three pass break-ups, three forced fumbles.) Joseph started every game as a freshman (team defensive player of the year with 104 tackles, seven for loss, two interceptions, three forced fumbles) and sophomore (68 tackles, three for loss, one interception), as well, earning honorable mention all-conference recognition each season.	Team captain and impactful Leader. Plays with passion and a deep love of the game. Play-making safety with man cover ability and plus ball skills. Took reps heads up against Sterling Shepard. Quick to get head around and find the ball and always opts to try and take the ball away rather than break up the pass. Leaper who challenges the high­-point. Finished with nine career interceptions and five this season in just four games. Plays run and pass with great urgency. True high/low option with toughness for the box and straight line speed to play rangy center field. Can pedal and shift from deep zone. Wolf looking for his next meal as a hitter.	ACL creates medical concerns and may prevent him from getting through an entire pre­-draft workout. Doesn't have desired thickness of frame for the ruckus he likes to bring as a hitter. Play-making aspirations can lead him to vacate his area a step early. Shows some change of direction limitations in coverage. Desire to assail leads to occasional technique breakdowns as a tackler.	Antoine Bethea	Fiercely competitive with immense football character. Different teams may have differing opinions of how best to utilize him, but Joseph has proven he can make plays in man coverage or play disciplined enough to be trusted on the back. His average size and subsequent durability will concern some teams due to his aggressive, attacking demeanor; however, Joseph is talented enough to become an early starter and high­-impact safety down the road if the medicals check out.	"Dana (Holgorsen) and that staff absolutely love him. He's a weapon because he can do just about anything you ask him to do which is different than most of the safeties in this draft who have limits. If he gets clean medicals before the draft I think he goes second day." -- AFC pro personnel director	29	5.75	karl-joseph	\N
2555360	V'Angelo	Bentley	14	70	190	\N	If Bentley was looking for a role model growing up, it didn't take long to find one. His mother, Angela, served two tours in Afghanistan and retired from the Air Force after 25 years of service. The work ethic instilled in him showed up early in college, as he worked his way onto the field as a freshman (11 tackles, three pass breakups, blocked field goal). As a sophomore, Bentley started eight games at cornerback (22 tackles, four for loss, one interception) and led the Big Ten in punt return average with 15.8 yards per attempt. Bentley became the first player in Illinois football history to return a punt, kickoff, fumble, and interception for a touchdown after getting the first two in 2013 and the last two in 2014. He earned honorable mention accolades in 2014 (46 tackles, 3.5 TFL, one INT, 815 kick/punt return yards) and 2015 (54 tackles, three TFL, sack, 743 kick/punt return yards).	Diverse talent. Only player in school history to score on a kick return, punt return, interception and fumble. Heavy, drag­-down tackler for his size. Allowed just one broken tackle and finished with 54 tackles on the season. Shows very good awareness to pre-snap movement and gets his secondary aligned with good communication. Actively attempts to redirect receivers in their routes from zone and sifts through combination routes quickly. Has some short area burst to the ball once he makes his read and fires forward. Has ability to challenge for a kick or punt return job early on.	Measured in shorter than expected at the Shrine Game. Can be mismatched from the slot by size. Doesn't possess high end twitch in coverage. Feet have brief stall when trying to click and close from his backpedal. Gives away too much room to receivers in space. Lack of feel for routes and inability to spring forward instantly caused low interception and pass break up totals. Needs to do a better job of getting his head around and finding the football when it is in the air.	\N	His lack of size is working heavily against him since he'll have to move inside to the slot, but the fact that Bentley has value as a return man and is a competitive tackler against the run gives him a puncher's chance to make a roster.	\N	30	5	vangelo-bentley	\N
2555343	Josh	Doctson	4	74	202	9.875	Doctson started his collegiate career at Wyoming before transferring back to his home state. He became Heisman Trophy candidate Trevone Boykin's favorite target (65 receptions, 1,018 yards, 11 TD) as a junior and ramped up his game even more in 2015, earning consensus first team All-American honors with a school-record 79 catches for 1,337 yards and 14 scores. Doctson only played in 11 games this year, only sparingly in one of those contests, as he suffered a wrist injury when players fell on him after a catch. The 2015 Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist finished second in TCU history in career receptions and yards, and set the record for touchdown receptions, despite starting his career at another school.	Targeted 36.5 percent of the time and has the mentality of a lead receiver. Silky vertical routes with ability to make subtle shifts to get past corners waiting to put hands on him. Consistent in his play speed. Good accelerator off stutter­-step release. Able to create late separation down the field with body lean and quiet hand usage. Touchdown maker who has rung up 25 receiving touchdowns over last two years despite missing three games this season. Climbs to snare jump balls and has body control to adjust in mid­air. Hands are very strong helping him secure catches through contact. Has ability to make defenses pay after the catch. Isn?t overwhelmed by physical cornerbacks trying to force him into the boundary and can play through it to make winning catches downfield.	Tall but needs to add more muscle to prepare for physical, press cornerbacks. Played in offense that created plenty of space to work in. Needs a greater commitment as a blocker. Was rarely pressed, but had issues coming out cleanly when he was. Doesn?t look sudden or urgent in his routes and is upright into his breaks. Out-­breaking routes are rounded and obvious. Suffered a broken wrist in early November.	Terrance Williams	Highly productive receiver with good height but in need of more functional mass for the NFL game. Doctson must prove he can play against press coverage if he is to reach his potential, but his ability to go up and win when the ball is in the air will endear him to quarterbacks. Scouts don't expect to be wowed by his 40 ­time, but most believe he'll be a solid No. 2 receiver in the league.	"I think he'll be a receiver that people start to find problems with and then he'll get 65­-70 catches by Year 2 or 3. He can really go get it when the ball is in the air. Those guys aren?t easy to find." -- NFC area scout	63	5.83000000000000007	josh-doctson	\N
2555344	Artie	Burns	14	72	193	9.5	Burns has been as successful a two-sport athlete as any football player has been in the last 20 years. He came to "The U" with a pedigree on the football field and the track, earning four-star recruit status while winning a state title in the 110 meter hurdles three times during his high school career (he had the top 110 meter and 300 meter hurdles times in the nation in his junior year). Burns translated that dual success in high school to the Hurricanes, winning All-American and All-Conference honors as a hurdler for the track and field squad and becoming one of the top corners in the ACC. Burns played in a reserve role as a freshman in 2013 (17 tackles, two sacks, three pass breakups) before becoming a starter in his sophomore year (40 tackles, six pass breakups). He flourished in 2015, intercepting six passes (most by a Miami player since Sean Taylor had 10 in 2003) and breaking up five others on his way to consensus second-team All-ACC honors. Unfortunately, Burns also suffered a great loss during his junior year, losing his mother after she suffered a heart attack. Since his father has been incarcerated for some time, the University of Miami started a donation fund to help his family get through the rough period -- they raised $40,000 in six hours. It was not surprising, therefore, that he wanted to declare for the 2016 NFL Draft as an early entrant.	Premium athlete with long, angular build and preferred blend of size and speed. One of the top 60-meter hurdlers in college track and field. Wakes up every morning with natural ball skills to flip the field. Got hands on high number of targeted throws, including six interceptions this season despite playing in a cornerback rotation. Will bait quarterbacks into trap throws. Has soft hands and catch radius of a receiver when it is time to take the ball away. Possesses brash, cocky demeanor. Length and physicality from press can be extremely disruptive. Burst on the throw is NFL-worthy. When he?s dialed in, has talent to be impactful. Usually finishes when he makes contact as tackler.	Tape isn't his best friend. Extremely raw and undisciplined. Leggy and grabby in routes. Flagged for four pass interference and two unsportsmanlike penalties. Upright in backpedal and plays with very little bend. High center of gravity prevents fluid change of direction. Coasts on athleticism and talent over proper technique. Turns motor off and on from game to game, and play can be lackadaisical. Would like to see him attack blockers rather than waiting for running back before disengaging.	David Amerson	While his tape is average and technique can be non­existent at times, NFL teams often draft on traits at the cornerback spot and assume that coaching will take care of the rest. Burns has length, speed, ball skills and abundant potential. Keep in mind he was limited in his growth at the position thanks to a spring track schedule. Burns will be a combine warrior and his draft stock will benefit, but he is still in the infant stages of reaching his pro potential.	"Tape is just average. Betting on the combine with him and he'll test off the charts. He's got the traits, but he's not ready yet. He's a good kid who has so much to deal with now that his mom has passed." -- NFL personnel executive.	23	5.71999999999999975	artie-burns	\N
2555345	Su'a	Cravens	13	73	226	9.5	Cravens' extended family has several NFL ties, including cousin Jordan Cameron (former USC and current Miami Dolphins tight end), distant cousin Manti Te'o (Notre Dame/San Diego Chargers linebacker) and his mother's second cousin David Fulcher (former Arizona State and Cincinnati Bengals safety). While those genes portend great athleticism, Cravens made his own name as the USA Today National High School Defensive Player of the Year in 2012 (97 tackles, eight sacks, three INT). He graduated from Vista Murrieta High a semester early to join USC for 2013, securing a starting spot at strong safety the following fall despite injuring his knee in the spring. Cravens made various Freshman All-American teams as well as honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice (52 tackles, four interceptions). He moved to a safety/linebacker hybrid role as a sophomore (a change he strongly resisted at first), leading the team with 17 tackles for loss (five sacks) and three interceptions to earn third team AP All-American and first-team All-Pac-12 accolades. Cravens repeated those honors in 2015, topping all Trojan defenders with 86 tackles, 15 for loss, and 5.5 sacks and once again showing his overall game by intercepting two passes and breaking up two others.	Born to be a football player. Combines smarts, instincts and toughness. Will not hesitate to jump into the mix and have proven his ability to make full­-time conversion to linebacker. Outstanding with his hands. Always first with his punch into blocker's frame and unlocks instant arm extension to keep himself clean. Showed ability to engage blocker, shuffle with square pads and disengage for the tackle. Scouts believe he will comfortably carry over 230 pounds in pros. Big boy production comes from always choosing play-making option over passive route. Loves to play on the other side of the line when possible. Sticky hands and can take the ball away if you give him a shot. Posted nine interceptions in three years. Aware in zone coverage, but has some blitz value. Will have immediate impact on special teams coverage.	Small for an NFL linebacker spot. Lack of length to consistently pull himself around the corner against edge blocks. Former safety who is still learning nuances of the position. Will take time to adjust to NFL power at the point of attack. Will get hooked inside and lose contain. Not as twitched up and fast as expected. Will get engulfed if he doesn't win early with hands. Unable to maintain feel for the target in his trail technique in man coverage. More likely to maul and grab over trusting technique in coverage. Willing to dive and miss rather than working for a higher percentage tackle.	Lavonte David	Plays with a unique lens that includes his time at the safety position as a freshman. Teams focusing on putting a "tweener" label on him could be making a huge mistake considering his competitive nature and toughness. Cravens was highly disruptive and productive in each of his three seasons as a starter thanks to his tools/traits to act on his instincts. Cravens will help on special teams immediately and could become an early starter for a 4-­3 defense looking for a playmaking weak­-side linebacker.	"He's a lot of fun to watch because he processes quickly like an NFL linebacker and then just fires into the play. I've never really cared about the size at the WILL, I just want to know if they have instincts and can run and make plays. That's it. He can do that." -- Former NFL general manager	50	6.09999999999999964	sua-cravens	\N
2555346	Will	Fuller	4	72	186	8.25	Fuller had a difficult decision on whether to leave Notre Dame early for the National Football League. Like many underclassmen before him, he initially believed he would return to campus, and then upon reflection, decided it was time to move on to the next level. It's hard to fault him after being named the Irish team MVP with 62 receptions for 1,258 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2015. Fuller wasn't a one-year wonder, however, as he had an outstanding sophomore campaign (76-1,094, 15 TD) and showed big-play promise (6-160, one score). He went to the same high school as Pro Football Hall of Fame candidate Marvin Harrison; Fuller?s lean build and ability to get deep on defenses will earn him comparisons based on their games as well as their upbringing.	Big time, vertical daddy. Had just over 27 percent of his catches go for 25-plus yards this year. Uses short, controlled strides into his routes for maximum balance and suddenness underneath. Will change routes speed to rock corners to sleep before climbing past them. Works to establish early leverage points against man coverage. Has elite acceleration to create easy separation vertically. Cornerbacks fear his speed giving him ample cushion. Able to drive defenders into early turn and bail when charging into his route. Shake a go release can whip press coverage. Can challenge and defeat press with nine routes and posts. Can make sharp in­-breaking cuts. Above average ball tracking skills and has good feel for the sideline at all times. Talented with the ball in his hands and can change direction without gearing down.	Undersized outside receiver with skinny legs who is unlikely to make a living in the middle of the field. Hands can be wretched at times (see Boston College game). Body catcher with focus issues and lack of hand strength. Logged nine drops in each of the last two seasons. Feast or famine target lacking frame and hands to be a volume receiver. Needs to improve route savvy for underneath and intermediate routes. Won't offer much at all as run blocker.	Ted Ginn, Jr.	Fuller doesn't check all the boxes with his slight frame, below average hands and limitations with his game-­by­-game production, but he possesses the coveted ability to hit the big play and score touchdowns. My grade might be higher than some, but Fuller has the type of functional speed that can win deep and free teammates up in the intermediate passing game. Look for Fuller to come in and contribute early on as a third receiver.	"I hear the DeSean Jackson comparison and I can't get there. DeSean was faster, tougher and more reliable than Fuller. I'm not saying Fuller can't play, but I don't think he's DeSean." -- Former NFL receiver and current scout	43	6.12999999999999989	will-fuller	\N
2555347	Michael	Thomas	4	75	212	10.5	Thomas is the nephew of former USC and NFL star receiver Keyshawn Johnson, which portends an excellent pro career. His road to this spot has been bumpy at times, however. Passed over by USC and UCLA as a high school recruit, Thomas went to Fork Union Military Academy (where he roomed with OSU quarterback Cardale Jones) instead of accepting scholarship offers from second-tier programs. He played in 11 games as a freshman, catching just three passes (22 yards) for the Buckeyes, and then was redshirted for the 2013 season just one game in because he was struggling to learn the offense and make his grades. Just one year later, Thomas became the leading receiver (54 catches, 799 yards, nine scores) on a national championship squad. He proved 2014 wasn?t a fluke by once again leading the Buckeyes with 56 catches, 781 yards, and nine touchdowns this fall, garnering third-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches and media. Thomas won't be picked No. 1 overall like his uncle, but an NFL team will see his potential as a Sunday playmaker.	Has the triangle numbers (height/weight/speed) of a WR1. Drives off the line of scrimmage selling his vertical push and forcing cornerbacks into passive position. Uses plus separation quickness at top of his route to provide comfortable passing window. Hands catcher who catches away from his frame when possible. Wasn't asked to work vertically much, but tape looks like he has a shot. Has the juice after catch to make defenses pay the price for missed tackles. Real red zone target who stacks the defender, tracks throw out of quarterback's hand and makes late play on the ball over top of defender. Has desired traits and flashes the tools.	Struggles with footwork out of press release spending excessive time trying to fake and shake cornerbacks. Still figuring out this whole "route running" thing. Needs to improve playing through contact and adjusting routes appropriately. Still thinking rather than just playing. Will have to work back to the throw more often on NFL level. Won't win over quarterbacks with inability to rescue the off-­target throws. Plays with passive field demeanor against aggressive cornerbacks. Won't go looking for work as run blocker if he doesn't have to. Doesn't appear to offer special teams value.	Charles Johnson	Thomas has just scratched the surface of his potential in Ohio State's offense full of quick outs and tunnel screens. While he has the size and potential to excite offensive coordinators, Thomas is still a work in progress who must develop a greater feel for the position if he is to match his traits with real NFL production. Thomas has a relatively high ceiling, but his floor is "bust."	\N	37	5.87000000000000011	michael-thomas	\N
2555348	Braxton	Miller	4	73	201	9.125	One of the more interesting stories in college football in 2015, Miller's descent from two-time Big Ten MVP to third-string passer could have ended badly. But after missing 2014 with a shoulder injury, Miller took on the challenge of switching to receiver for his senior year. Bragging that he was the "best athlete in college football", Miller looked prophetic with outstanding open-field moves and speed in the limited opportunities he received this season (24 catches, 329 yards, three TD receiving; 40 carries, 234 yards, one TD rushing). His elusiveness with the ball wasn?t surprising, as he had rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 2012 and 2013, but the natural hands he showed as a receiver make him an intriguing prospect.	Considered one of the leaders for the winningest senior class in college football history. Immediately checks boxes for height, weight and speed. Features legitimate vertical acceleration to climb over the top on deep routes. Hands are good enough, but concentration is even better. Uses well-­timed leaps and dives to make the demanding catches. Capability as a zone­-read quarterback create added value. Has loose hips for jitterbug elusiveness in space and it isn?t easy to get a solid hit on him.	Just one year of work at receiver and has limited production as a pass-catcher. Reliant upon speed and athletic ability over skill at the position. Needs major route work. Upright into his routes with very little sell from his upper body to create hesitation from defenders. Not yet ready to work the intermediate routes. Used deep and short. Needs to improve his ball security and get ball tucked away in proper arm.	Andre Roberts	Miller had a storied two-year run at quarterback where he was able to produce explosive, winning plays for the Buckeyes. His transition to a new position will be a work in progress that may last longer than some expect, but his size, speed and athletic traits are appealing. Miller?s ability with the ball in his hands could help his cause, but the difference between being a gadget player and productive receiver will rest with his ability to digest coaching and convert it on the field.	"He's going to go by at least the third round because of his speed and athleticism. He's got some traits that will get him drafted early and a team will worry about coaching him up after they get him in." -- NFC executive	37	5.61000000000000032	braxton-miller	\N
2555349	Kendall	Fuller	14	71	187	\N	Fuller was the fourth Fuller brother to suit up for Virginia Tech, and will be the fourth to play in the NFL, and probably the most talented of them all. Vincent played seven years in the league as a safety, Corey lines up as a reserve receiver for the Detroit Lions, and Kyle has played well at corner for Chicago after they made him a first-round pick in 2014. Kendall, a high school All-American, simply came into Bud Foster's defense as a true freshman, starting 12 games, intercepting six passes, and garnering Freshman All-American, second-team All-ACC and Defensive Rookie of the Year honors. Fuller continued to impress in his sophomore year, earning second team All-American notice from multiple outlets and first team all-conference nods from coaches and media alike (4.5 tackles for loss, two interceptions, 15 pass breakups) -- all while playing with a fractured wrist on which he had surgery after the season. Unfortunately, the injury bug bit Fuller again before the 2015 season, as he tore the meniscus in his right knee during preseason camp. He attempted to play through the injury, but decided to hang it up after three games (seven tackles, sack) to have it repaired. Rather than return to Virginia Tech after head coach Frank Beamer retired, Fuller decided to head to the next level as an early draft entrant to join his brothers.	Supremely confident and believes he should make the biggest plays on the field. Looks to feast on unsuspecting quarterbacks. Has the feet and twitch to trigger and go when he reads the quarterback's intentions. Takes a direct path to the ball. Ball hawk in the short and intermediate passing game. Logged 34 passes defensed and eight interceptions in 2013 and 2014 combined. Savvy and trusts his instincts. Good coordination from press coverage and can track releases both inside and out. Understands the body game and gets into the chest of receivers while running downfield. Willing tackler who steps downhill and doesn?t miss his mark very often.	Lacking desired size and length for the outside spot. Doesn't have the recovery speed to be able to take as many chances on the pro level. Lacks field discipline. Gambler who will get his knot chopped by double moves and pump fakes. Allowed 16.7 yards per completion when he was fully healthy in 2014. Needs to get better at finding the ball when he?s beaten over the top. His play style could lead to early penalty issues. Tried to play through a torn meniscus and ended up shutting it down after the first three games of the season.	Kyle Fuller	The playmaking production didn't happen by accident. Fuller has the twitch and the anticipation to challenge throws on the NFL level and come away with his fair share of interceptions, but scouts are very leery of the chances he is willing to take as they have concerns about his ability to carry long speed. With the way Fuller plays the ball in front of him combined with his tackling prowess, his home could be with a Tampa­ 2-oriented defense that values physical, zone corners over speed.	\N	28	5.63999999999999968	kendall-fuller	\N
2555350	Kolby	Listenbee	4	72	197	8.25	After two seasons of providing minimal production, Listenbee received his chance to shine in 2014, earning honorable mention All-Big 12 accolades with 41 catches for 783 yards and four scores. He again made big plays throughout his senior campaign, repeating as an honorable mention nominee even though he missed two games due to injury. Listenbee led the team with a 19.9 yards-per-catch average (30-597, five touchdowns) in 2015, which isn't surprising given his success as a sprinter; he was a four-time All-American for TCU for his work in the 100-meter dash (10.03 wind-aided best), as well as the 4x100 and 4x400 relays.	Able to win deep against man coverage. Averaged 19 yards per catch and 16 yards at the point of the catch in 2015. Natural hands. Doesn't typically have to fight the ball and shows very good concentration to eyeball throws into his hands. Adequate ball tracking and makes late adjustments on deep throws. Good hand fighter to free himself to be catch­-ready. Has second gear to run under throws. Adjusts well to low throws and can go dig them out.	Gangly with a frame that is too thin at this time. Takes an excessive amount of time to gear down into his breaks and is slow to turn and find the ball. Long-strider. Shows meager effort as blocker on wide receiver screens and in the running game. Saw targets and deep ball production fall off this season.	\N	Intriguing draft prospect with good height, hands and ball skills and the second gear to threaten defenses deep. Listenbee won't help much as a run blocker and he's not sudden enough to be a consistent worker from the slot, but winning deep can produce touchdowns which will get him into a camp.	\N	63	5.07000000000000028	kolby-listenbee	\N
2555353	Alex	Lewis	7	78	312	\N	Trying to make his own name in a new place, Lewis chose to start his college career in Boulder to play for the Buffaloes instead of following his father, Bill, to Lincoln where he was an All-American center in 1985. Alex played in 24 games, starting 15 (12 at LG, one at LT, two as blocking TE), for Colorado and then had surgery on his shoulder following the 2012 season. Lewis decided to transfer to Nebraska in the spring of 2013, redshirting that season before staking the starting left tackle spot for all 26 games in 2014 and 2015. He was named honorable mention All-Big Ten as a junior and second-team All-Conference by league coaches as a senior. Lewis now plans on following in his father?s footsteps to the NFL, where his dad played seven years for the Raiders, Cardinals, and Patriots. Scouts will ask Lewis about his arrest for assaulting an Air Force cadet in May 2013, as he eventually received 45 days in jail and two years' probation in exchange for dropping the felony counts.	Has some toughness to his game and will meet a physical challenge. Has a clean, balanced set­up in pass protection and keeps his head back and hands punch­-ready. Generally uses well-­timed punch with inside hand coming first. Understands his physical limitations and sets out on defensive ends quickly to counter. Able to generate some play at the tackle spot.	Plodding feet limit him. Slow to step into angle blocks and has issues operating consistently on outside zone plays. Not quick enough to be counted on for reach blocks. Pad level too high to unlock hips for maximum leverage and pop in run game. Needs to get better at sinking hips as bull rush mounts. Play strength is very average and leads to balance issues. Will lunge rather than working feet into position. Punch needs to be more crisp and quick.	\N	Lewis has enough frame and length to stay at tackle, but will need to move over to the right side even though he may be able to offer average value as a swing tackle. Run blocking in space will always be a concern and his foot quickness could cause issues for him against NFL speed off the edge. There is enough there to work with Lewis as a backup tackle.	\N	16	5.13999999999999968	alex-lewis	\N
2555361	Glenn	Gronkowski	3	74	239	9.5	With three brothers already experiencing the NFL, it seemed logical for Glenn to head to the league a year early. Rob stars at tight end for the New England Patriots, while Chris and Dan had their time in the professional ranks as well. (His oldest brorther, Gordie, played minor league baseball.) Glenn played a fullback role at Kansas State, participating in every game the last three seasons while getting starts in 20 of those 39 contests. His role as a fullback resulted in limited offensive production, but he found himself on an all-conference team each year. In 2013, he was an honorable mention pick (5-194, three TD receiving) by league coaches, the following year Gronkowski was a first team pick (5-99 receiving, TD; 4-6 rush) by coaches as well, and he finished off his career with a second-team all-conference effort (5-76 receiving, TD; 11-45 rush, TD).	From athletic, football family. Utilized in running game and runs with some conviction. Gets good upward hand strike at point of attack and rolls hips through contact. Hand strength to sustain his blocks. Goal line pass-catching option. Has enough vertical speed to work up the field. Saw six of his 15 career catches go for 25-plus yards.	Doesn't have great feel and instincts as run blocker. Will need to bring more funk behind his pads if he wants to win iso­ blocks against NFL inside linebackers. Works within offense, but doesn't create big play opportunities on his own. Limited elusiveness as a runner.	Chris Gronkowski	When you get past his famous brother, you are left with a versatile player who isn't overly dangerous as a pass catcher or physical as a run blocker. Glenn Gronkowski has some talent and could offer some scheme versatility, but he needs to make great strides as either a blocker or pass catcher to make his own mark in the league.	"Maybe the name will carry the day with the public, but he's just a fullback to us. He's not 'Gronk'". -- AFC area scout	14	5	glenn-gronkowski	\N
2555354	Chris	Swain	3	72	247	9.5	As if facing Navy's option attack led by star quarterback Keenan Reynolds wasn't enough, defenses had to deal with Swain coming downhill at them. The 2015 second team All-American Athletic Conference pick set career highs in yards (1,023) and touchdowns (10) in his senior season. Swain wasn't a one-year wonder, though, as he had over 1,100 yards and eight scores over the previous two seasons as only a part-time starter. When not running the ball, Swain shows a willingness to bang bodies and stick on a block in the hole, so NFL teams will consider bringing him into a training camp and work with him through his military commitment.	Built dive back in Navy's triple-option attack. Drops pad level to bring pop behind his pads at collision point as ball carrier. Will show some late movement before contact to sneak extra yardage from his run. Not shifty but has functional movement in the hole. Launches himself into defender's thighs as cut blocker. Appears to have the stomach for necessary contact as a fullback on next level. Has chain-moving potential.	Not a true lead blocker at this time. Will lower head and miss his target as a blocker on the edge occasionally. Pass protection needs work. Not a smooth runner. Runs with pronounced rocking motion as he approaches the line of scrimmage. Allows second level tacklers to be the low man too often at point of collision. Only two catches during his time at Navy.	\N	Dive back with adequate running talent who may carry some value as a fullback and a short-yardage option. Swain will need to prove that he can improve as a blocker and special teams contributor to maximize his roster value. The Senior Bowl week is a huge opportunity to make a statement for Swain.	\N	42	4.91999999999999993	chris-swain	\N
2555355	Clayton	Fejedelem	15	73	200	\N	\N	Willing to come downhill and get it on in the running game. Willing worker from the box. Heads up form tackler who springs into his opponent's chest. Finished with 140 tackles this season. When he?s near the ball, willing to attack catch point to disrupt the throw rather than just play for the post-catch tackle. Box safety who shows decent awareness of route development around him. Steady from zone coverage.	Stiff, box­-only safety without the man cover skills or footwork to be a consistent defender against the pass. Change of direction doesn't always go smoothly in open field. Had 11 missed tackles in 2015. Needs to run feet through his tackles. Missing closing burst to make plays on throws and constrict throwing windows to NFL standards.	\N	Very tough with the mindset teams are looking for from box safeties. Unfortunately, box safeties are being replaced by safeties with better cover talent and athleticism and that may be an issue for Fejedelem. He will need to ball out as a special-teamer and find a fit with a team who still employs box workers at safety.	\N	30	4.95999999999999996	clayton-fejedelem	\N
2555356	Keenan	Reynolds	2	71	205	\N	\N	As with most option quarterbacks, has heart for days as a runner and competitor. Elevated sense of purpose when play neared the goal line. Cashed in with 78 rushing touchdowns over the last three seasons. Can make himself slippery and rarely takes direct shots unless he seeks out the contact. Forced 23 missed tackles this season. Has plus vision with a great sense of when to cut it up and when to finish his runs. Runs with outstanding balance through contact. Elite intelligence and locker room leader.	Doesn't have the frame or leg thickness of full­-time, NFL running back. More slippery than shifty as a runner. Lacking dynamic one-­cut ability to hit holes with burst. Thin lower half makes his running style slightly top ­heavy in space. Has to prove he can catch the football as a running back. Not strong enough to extend runs through force. Credited with just two broken tackles over his last 515 carries. Ball security is a concern. Had 32 fumbles with 18 lost during his time at Navy.	Fozzy Whittaker	Reynolds is more than tough enough for the NFL game, but his ball security issues are a major concern as he tries to step into the role of an NFL running back. Reynolds is tough but not physical to the point of breaking tackles so he must prove he can be creative and elusive and he has to show good hands to become a pass catching option as well. Adding to a return game could help his cause.	\N	42	4.95999999999999996	keenan-reynolds	\N
2555357	Ken	Crawley	14	72	187	\N	Since his freshman year, Crawley has used his height and long arms to distract and disrupt receivers downfield. He broke up 21 passes in his first three seasons, intercepting two others (both in 2013). Crawley continued his progress as a player during his senior year, making 46 tackles while adding another 13 pass breakups and an interception to his career totals. Crawley's lack of interceptions kept him from receiving post-season accolades, but his height and length should earn him a long look at the next level.	Good height. Three-year starter who has played over 78 percent of the team's defensive snaps in all four seasons. Shows patience out of back pedal. Won't open to one side or the other based on basic, first move by receiver. Flashed bursts of athleticism in Shrine Game practices and was able to open hips and transition into a sprint. Has mirror and match ability on stop and go routes. Consistent tackle production. Has balanced approach and usually drives through running back?s legs in run support.	Has had significant issues with discipline in his coverage. Not as vigilant as he should be in off coverage and allows people over the top of him with go routes and double moves. Plays high in his back­pedal. Doesn't trust his technique down the field. Has been hit with a whopping 12 pass interference penalties over last two years. Needs more play strength and assertiveness to challenge blockers in run support. Has just three interceptions to 19 touchdowns allowed over his career. Lack of hustle in back­side run support cost his team in Stanford game.	\N	Crawley definitely had some flash moments at the Shrine Game practices, but teams value production and there is no getting around his astounding number of touchdowns allowed and pass interference penalties. If Crawley runs well, teams may view him as a developmental prospect in need of technique work, but his inconsistency in coverage and lack of plays on the ball may be a sign of confidence issues and a lack of instincts.	"He's got a little something to him. I like the way he moves out there. I need to watch him." -- AFC executive at East-West Shrine Game practice	11	5.08000000000000007	ken-crawley	\N
2555358	Quinton	Jefferson	10	76	291	8.875	A highly regarded high school recruit from Pennsylvania, Jefferson's career got off to a shaky start. His jaw was broken during a fight back home, putting off the beginning of his workouts with teammates. He came back, though, to play in nine games as a reserve (13 tackles) as a true freshman. Finally healthy and familiar with the defensive scheme, he started all 13 games in 2013 (45 tackles, 7.5 for loss, three sacks). Looking to build upon that performance, Jefferson started three games in 2014 (eight tackles, one for loss) but suffered a torn right ACL against West Virginia. He came back with a vengeance for his redshirt junior year, earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors with 12.5 tackles for loss, 6.5 sacks, interceptions, and a blocked kick. The father of three then decided it was time to move on to the next level instead of returning to Maryland for his fifth campaign with the Terps.	Can come off the snap with low pad level and make initial penetration with leverage into the gap. Is a different player when his motor is right. Shows some disruptive qualities when he commits to the attack. Rushes passer with head fakes and stutter steps that create uncertainty in blockers. Flashes upper body strength. Has a nifty swim move tied to a jump ­cut for his go­-to inside move. Married with children. Scouts consider him grounded.	As play develops, pad level rises and allows himself to be redirected with punches under his armpit. Doesn't fire off the snap and into blockers with much juice. Rushes with a narrow base causing balance inconsistencies. Has thin ankles and below average lower body power. Lack of power in his base prevents him from fighting back against wash down blocks on the move. Suffered a torn ACL in 2014 that will have to pass medicals.	\N	High cut 3-­technique with good upper body strength but below average lower body power to take a stand. Jefferson flashes penetration ability and some pass rushing talent, but he needs to be fitted to a 1­-gap, upfield defense and will have to make a team as a rotational lineman.	\N	5	5.12999999999999989	quinton-jefferson	\N
2555363	Henry	Krieger Coble	5	75	248	9.25	Krieger-Coble and his first cousin, George Kittle (their mothers were sisters), formed a solid one-two punch at tight end for the Hawkeyes in their successful 2015 campaign. Krieger-Coble had to wait until this senior year, though, to break through for head coach Kirk Ferentz. He started one game in his redshirt freshman year (in a two-TE set), catching four passes for 30 yards and a touchdown. As a sophomore, he caught no passes despite playing in all 13 games. Krieger-Coble earned three starts in his junior year, catching three passes for 28 yards and two scores, but missed the final three games due to a shoulder injury. He finally was rewarded with the starting job in 2015, finishing second on the team with 35 receptions for 405 yards and one touchdown for a Hawkeyes squad that finished the regular season undefeated.	Comes out of his stance with purpose. Plays fast and with a sense of urgency. Has good shake out of his stems to gain advantage against coverage. Can sell linebackers into wrong turns in coverage with stutter steps and head fakes. Hard-nosed Hawkeye. Sturdy build with strength in his lower half for balance through contact. Will drop his head and deliver a blow after the catch. Can run through arm tackles. Knee­-bender counted on to do his part as in­line blocker. Capable cut-­blocker. Makes accurate initial contact with defender and brings his feet with him. Well-­schooled as run blocker.	Started full-­time just one season. Doesn't have desired length as an in­line tight end. Catch radius is just average and won?t come down with many acrobatic catches. Hands appear to be solid, but he'll fight the ball from time to time. Has issues bodying his way out of coverage once defenders get into his frame down the field. True cover talent causes issues for him. Fumbled twice this season.	Luke Willson	Determined combination tight end with the potential to play in­line or as a move tight end. Krieger­-Coble was a three-sport star in high school and played multiple positions on the football field, which accounts for his athleticism and competitiveness. He might not blow teams away with freaky traits, but his tape shows the potential to help in a zone blocking scheme as well as the ability to win against man coverage.	\N	32	5.26999999999999957	henry-krieger coble	\N
2555364	Tyler	Higbee	5	78	249	10.25	Western Kentucky has had a bit of a run at the tight end position the past few years, with Jack Doyle drafted by the Colts in 2013 and Mitchell Henry getting his shot with multiple teams last summer. Higbee could be the best of the trio. The converted receiver added weight to his frame and when given the chance to show his stuff against Marshall as a junior, made six catches for 99 yards and three scores. He built on that in 2015, teaming up with two-time Conference USA MVP to put up some of the best numbers for any tight end in the country (38-563, eight TD) despite missing five-plus games with a knee injury.	Former wide receiver with a smooth, wide­-open gait when he hits top gear. Has big hands. Had just one drop this season and showed ability to recover the catch when he juggled a throw. Becomes a body catcher who can protect the ball in traffic. Willing to work middle of the field and take hits. Quick and slippery off line of scrimmage and into routes. Very good acceleration out of his breaks and can be a tough cover for safeties. Has the speed and toughness to work all three levels of the field. Can own the Y­-seam with his vertical speed and hands. Immediately opens and looks for expedited throws when he's over the top of inside linebackers. Has frame for more muscle mass. Extremely competitive after the catch with speed, elusiveness and decent power. Can carry body tacklers after the catch.	Still has work to do filling out his frame. Slow to adjust to blocking assignment during flow of play. Not powerful enough yet to handle NFL edge power as in­line blocker. Doesn't run feet through block to sustain. Upright into his breaks. Needs route polish for underneath routes. Can get better at creating additional leverage through crisper routes. Suffered through a knee sprain that cost him four games before re-aggravating it in Conference USA Championship Game. Missed his bowl game and expected to miss Senior Bowl because of it.	Jordan Cameron	Knee injury basically took six games away from him this season which could cause him to fly under the radar a little bit. Higbee has exciting athleticism and speed in the open field with the ability to separate from safeties on intermediate routes and threaten the deep middle. Higbee has soft, reliable hands and plus run-­after­-catch ability to finish plays. While he needs to beef up his frame and blocking ability, there is no doubting his pass catching talent.	\N	444	5.63999999999999968	tyler-higbee	\N
2555365	Brandon	Allen	1	73	217	8.875	A three-year starter for the Razorbacks, Allen really came on in the second half of his senior year to open the eyes of scouts. In fact, the Fayetteville native, son of the school's director of high school and NFL relations, and one-time Arkansas High School Player of the Year improved each year. He completed less than 50 percent of his passes for 1,552 yards and 13 touchdowns as a sophomore, hit 56 percent of his passes for 2,285 yards and 20 scores in 2014, and then connected on 66 percent of throws in 2015 for 3,340 yards and 30 touchdowns (against just eight interceptions). This improvement isn't lost on the eyes of NFL teams.	Showed substantial growth as field leader and play­maker. Comfortable under center and is effective on bootlegs and rollouts. Completion percentage jumped from 56 percent in 2014 to 66 percent this year. Outstanding 64 percent rate on intermediate throws. Good catch­-and­-run ball placement on crossing routes. Sneaky arm talent. Able to pump fake, re­set and throw with accuracy. Swift setup in the pocket with a prompt release. Gets ball out in rhythm in rollouts. Rotates hips through throws for quality velocity. Arm to make NFL throws and has drive velocity and accuracy to challenge tight windows in middle of the field. Able to extend plays outside the pocket and find a throw or scramble for first downs. Doubled completions of 20-plus yards from 24 (2014) to 48 this year.	Smallish frame takes hard hits when he runs. Benefited from play-­action based passing attack. Just over 40 percent of his dropbacks were out of play­-action. Rarely looks to take deep shots down the sideline against man coverage. Not asked to get through very many progressions and brings safeties to his throws by staring down his targets. Could make life easier by moving safeties around with his eyes. When pocket heats up, he will drop eyes and look to bolt.	Case Keenum	Allen was an afterthought headed into this season but garnered draft attention with high­-end production and a substantial spike in his play. On one hand, he is smaller than teams usually like and operated out of a play-­action offense that didn?t ask him to get through many progressions. On the other hand, Allen has a quick release, an NFL arm, solid accuracy and good mobility. Allen needs to find the right home and eliminate his tendency to stare down targets, but he has enough talent to become an NFL backup.	\N	89	5.45000000000000018	brandon-allen	\N
2555366	Deiondre'	Hall	14	74	199	9.75	Hall's head coach, Mark Farley, has stated that Hall could play any position on defense because of his good attitude, football intelligence, and tenacious nature. He started at safety as a freshman, played as a lean rover at times his sophomore year, and then moved to the outside later that year before starring at the position in 2014 (racking up 74 tackles and five picks). Farley and his defensive coaches moved Hall between corner and safety in 2015, and he saw success in both spots, earning multiple All-American honors and the Missouri Valley Football Conference Defensive Player of the Year award with 82 tackles, 5.5 for loss, and three forced fumbles. He also returned two of his league-best six interceptions for touchdowns, giving him a school-record four "pick sixes" in his career.	Has the arm length of a left tackle. Long arms are extremely disruptive against 50/50 balls. Uses length to stuff blockers and get into the action. Values run support and tackling and is never shy. Unusually high tackle count for a cornerback (82 this season) and forced three fumbles. Not intimidated by physical receivers from bigger programs. Offers help outside his area if he reads quarterback?s intentions. Closes the deal when he has a shot at an interception finishing with 13 for his career including six this year. Instinctive and aware in thirds coverage and looked comfortable playing from safety slot.	Sticky inside foot that is slow to react against quick, inside release against press coverage. Lanky body doesn't come with loose hips. Struggles to open and run with speed when beaten off the line. Recovery speed is below average. Long strider missing stop-­start athletic traits to maintain tight, man coverage. Uses jabs to receivers downfield as safety net that will be called penalties in the pros. Doesn't have desired bulk and strength as a safety.	Trumaine Johnson	Long and lanky with the arm length and interception production that will have teams trying to find a spot for him. Hall doesn't have the speed or mirror and match ability to be a sticky man­-cover cornerback and his thin frame isn?t ideal as a safety. However, Hall's instincts and tackle production scream safety if he can add muscle to his frame.	\N	327	5.42999999999999972	deiondre-hall	\N
2555367	Jake	Coker	1	77	236	9.5	Coker was inconsistent, at best, this season as the starter for the Crimson Tide after getting on the field in just 17 games while at Florida State (2011-2013) and his first year at Alabama. Coker backed up first round pick E.J. Manuel in 2012 and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston in 2013, seeing limited time. He could not beat out veteran Blake Sims for the starting job once arriving in Tuscaloosa, though he did play a bit (38-59, 64.4 percent, 403 yards, four TD, no INT in 7 games). But as Coker's first year as a starter progressed, there was improvement that NFL teams undoubtedly noticed. He won Offensive MVP honors in the Cotton Bowl win over Michigan State (25-30, 286 yards, two TD), which sent the Tide to the national title game against Clemson. Coker passed for a career-high 335 yards, connecting with tight end O.J. Howard for two scores, helping Alabama win its fourth title in seven years.	Outstanding size and overall build and looks the part of an NFL quarterback. When needed, can call on more heat on his fastball. Finished the season with 30 completions of 25-plus yards. Throws deep ball with touch and enough accuracy. Classic step-­and­-throw delivery with sound mechanics from the pocket. Ball comes out with a tight spiral. Is generally accurate with solid ball placement when feet are planted and comfortable. Poise is okay. Despite size is a functional scrambler out of the pocket with six carries going for 15-plus yards. Played his best football in the postseason.	Deliberate to the point of being slow in his set­up. Delivery and release are lethargic allowing linemen to bat throws down and corners to get a head start. Needs plays to stay on schedule. May not have arm talent and twitch to cut accurate throws loose from off-­balance angles. Accuracy becomes very iffy when rolling out to his right. Stares down targets. Plenty of single read throws. Will run himself into sacks and pressure. Not a fit for "hero ball". Needs to get rid of ball rather than keep trying to make something happen.	Dan Orlovsky	He has the size, touch and ability to threaten defenses vertically that will intrigue many teams. His six-touchdown, no-interception run from SEC Championship Game through the playoffs should not be ignored. While I have concerns about his delivery speed causing NFL passing windows to close down, I wouldn't be surprised to see Coker take a big move up the draft board as there will likely be a team that sees his late-season play as a sign of his NFL potential with more coaching and experience.

2555368	Jeff	Overbaugh	20	72	236	9.625	The Overbaughs take serious road trips to watch their son, Jeff, play for the Aztecs. They live in Alaska, where his father, Bill, is the recreational director of the state's Bureau of Land Management. They've been able to see him play from Day 1, as he took over the snapping duties as a true freshman. Four years and 53 games later, he's been about as reliable for the Aztecs as a collegiate long snapper can be, connecting on 510 straight snaps. Chris Rubio, a well-known snapping instructor, named Overbaugh second team All-American for the 2015 season.	Good snap speed­ and accuracy for field goals and punts. Balls comes out with a tight spiral and finishes laces out most of the time on field goals. Has never bounced or snapped it over the holder or punter's head. Attended long-­snapping camps in the summer growing up. Trained by long snap guru Chris Rubio.	Camped amongst Kodiak bears growing up.	Joe Cardona	Has the snap speed and outstanding accuracy to get a shot in the league. While it isn't easy to break into the NFL long­-snappers club, he also has decent size with room to get bigger. Overbaugh's willingness to tackle helps.	\N	78	5	jeff-overbaugh	\N
2555369	Jimmy	Landes	20	73	240	9.625	Long snappers are typically not two-sport athletes in college, but Landes managed the feat during his time at Baylor. An honorable mention all-state pick from Tyler, Texas, Landes walked on as a snapper on the football team for the 2011 season and got on the field much more quickly than anticipated. An injury to the starting snapper in the second game of the year put Landes on the field for 11 games as a true freshman. Although he acquitted himself well, he decided to redshirt in football for 2012 so he could focus on catching for the Bears' baseball squad. With limited success on the diamond (four starts, .048 batting average), he came back to the football team in 2013 as a back-up. The lead snapper job -- and a scholarship -- opened up before the 2014 season, and Landes excelled in the position in both his junior and senior seasons.	Former college catcher at Baylor. Good accuracy on his punt snaps with decent snap speed. Accurate field goal snapper all of 2015.	Not a great athlete to chase for tackles on punt coverage. Had minor issues with snap accuracy on field goals in 2014.	\N	Three-year, full­-time snapper who has been a mainstay at Baylor. Coverage and snap speed will be closely monitored if Landes is to have a shot at getting into a camp.	\N	10	4.70000000000000018	jimmy-landes	\N
2555370	Jordan	Payton	4	73	207	10.125	Payton finished his career as the UCLA record-holder for career receptions, grabbing 201 passes in his four year on campus. A four-star recruit from famed Oaks Christian High School, he helped his team win two state titles. Payton didn?t take long to make an impact with the Bruins, starting four times as a true freshman (18-202, one TD in 13 games) and 10 times as a sophomore (38-440, one TD). He led the team with 67 catches for 957 yards and seven touchdowns in his second year as a starter in 2014, and upped his game even more last fall (78-1,105 yards, five scores) playing with freshman passer Josh Rosen. The two-time honorable mention All-Pac 12 selection by league coaches also has an entrepreneurial side, as he began Long Awaited clothing line with two friends while in high school.	Thickly built for a wideout with broad shoulders. Productive target over last two seasons with 145 catches. Works back to the throw. Bodies up smaller corners and keeps them away from the throw. Has strength in his hands to brush away press coverage or latch onto cornerbacks and sustain blocks as a run blocker. Finished 2015 with 14 catches of 25-plus yards.	Painfully slow in his release and attempt to maneuver around press coverage. Struggles to avoid redirect blows inside of his routes and takes time to gear back up. Needs a long runway to build­up his vertical speed. Doesn't have get­away speed to maintain any separation he creates. Will have to live with contested catch opportunities.	\N	Payton is a broad-­shouldered "catch what I'm supposed to" type of receiver who has a plus ability to help running games with his blocking, but a lack of speed and athleticism to beat coverage. His size might be too much to pass up on.	\N	52	5.08000000000000007	jordan-payton	\N
2555371	Joe	Haeg	7	78	304	9.625	Every draft since 2010 has seen at least one offensive lineman from a non-FBS school drafted in the top 100. Haeg is this year's best candidate, as the 2014 (AP, AFCA) and 2015 (AP, Walter Camp) All-American hopes to follow in his former teammate's shoes; tackle Billy Turner was drafted in the third round by Miami in 2014. This former walk-on received the Top Collegiate Offensive Lineman award from the FCS Athletic Directors Association in 2015, as well. Haeg, a two-time first team All-Missouri Valley Conference pick, started 60 of a possible 61 games (29 at right tackle, 32 on the left side after Turner went to the NFL).	Athletic build with potential to add more bulk to his frame. Four-year starter who comes from winning program. Has played both tackle spots. Plays with good posture in his pass sets and uses his length effectively. Can get to the perimeter quickly and seal the edge when asked to short pull around the corner. Agile with lateral quickness. Drives his feet up and along line of scrimmage to maintain leverage in zone engagement. Doesn't panic against spin moves in pass rush.	Gets caught on the balls of his feet in pass pro rather than sitting down to throw his punch. Needs more knee bend in pass sets. Core strength looks like a major concern. Wasn't challenged by premier athletes on the edge. Timing on combo blocks needs work. Shows better athletic ability laterally than when asked to find targets in space. Zone scheme only lineman. Leans and pushes rather than driving with his lower body. Struggles to sustain and control his blocks even when he wins early in rep.	James Hurst	While the pedigree and the body type look the part, continued tape study begins to uncover core strength issues that permeate several facets of his game. As a run blocker, his inability to drive and sustain blocks is a concern while his pass protection shows a good, initial pass set that turns into leaning to make up for his lack of anchor. While Haeg has the athletic traits of a zone blocking tackle, it won't matter without better functional power.	\N	317	5.29000000000000004	joe-haeg	\N
2555372	K.J.	Dillon	15	72	210	9.625	Dillon stepped up his game in his senior year after teammate Karl Joseph went down to injury. He finished with 55 tackles, 7.5 for loss, two interceptions and eight pass break-ups, garnering second team All-Big 12 accolades. Dillon went through the typical ascension through his career in Morgantown, playing on special teams and as a reserve safety as a true freshman (20 tackles, forced fumble) before becoming a part-time starter in 2013 (28 tackles, three for loss, team-leading six pass breakups). He only played in nine games that year, however, because a case of severe dehydration suffered in November landed him first in the hospital and then on the sideline for the remainder of the season. Dillon came back with a vengeance as a junior, though, starting 12 games, making 62 tackles, and tying for the team lead with three interceptions and seven pass breakups.	Angular with good overall length. Makes attacking the catch point a priority. Has had 20 passes defensed and five interceptions over the last two seasons. Shows an ability to play high or low. Reads his keys and fires downhill to support. Good athleticism. Shows some man cover ability from the slot. Responsive to receivers who try and cross his face in zone. Plays with reactive athleticism and burst to click and close on throws. Involved tackler from near the box.	His "turn and run" speed takes time to ramp up from man coverage. Mechanical and stiff in his backpedal. Holds when he thinks he?s beaten. Catch and drag tackler around the box with limited high-impact production as tackler. Doesn't run through his tackles and can be taken for a ride by running backs. Too many missed tackles when coming downhill without enough body control.	\N	Athletic safety who flashes enough ability high and low to believe that he won?t be pigeon­holed as one type of safety or another. Dillon has the athleticism and ball skills to help in man coverage and enough awareness from the high safety spot to handle his duties. Dillon has allowed entirely too many missed or broken tackles over the last couple of seasons, but that can be improved with more muscle on his frame and a more technique-­driven approach. Intriguing prospect with developmental traits.	\N	29	5.24000000000000021	k.j.-dillon	\N
2555373	K.J.	Maye	4	68	194	8.5	It was a childhood dream for Maye to play in the 2016 Reese's Senior Bowl, as he grew up in Mobile, playing his games at Ladd-Peebles Stadium and attending Senior Bowl practices. His inclusion in the game as a late add was not just due to Mobile being his hometown, however. Maye's athleticism was evident early in his career with the Gophers, as he started twice as a true freshman, rushing for 57 yards on 17 carries and catching 11 passes for 49 yards. His contributions did not increase in 2013 (one start; 2-19 rushing; 7-70 receiving), but coaches utilized his quickness a bit more in his junior campaign (five starts; 23-144, TD rushing; 16-298, TD receiving). That taste of production caused Maye to double his efforts last season, leading to consensus honorable mention All-Big Ten honors (73-773, five TD receiving; 9-46, TD rushing). And though his experience as a kick (18-313) and punt (4-56) returner for Minnesota were limited, Maye will likely get his shot there at the next level.	Will not be outworked in practice. Mentally tough and extremely resilient overcoming obstacles from junior high up to college. Consistent in his play speed in and out of his breaks. Uses burst and above average routes to uncover against man and twitch-to-field awareness to open windows against zone. Able to sell complex routes and makes them work for him. Makes contested catches he has no business making and plays with great feet near the sideline. The more you watch, the more you like. High school quarterback and point guard with leadership traits. Has strong, supportive parents.	Expected to measure at under 5-foot-10. Doesn't have the length to protect the ball against intrusive, tight coverage. Willing blocker but teams may not trust the size. Quick, but lacks a top gear. Scouts believe he might be limited as a short-­area slot target only. Used as jet­-back but didn't show enough wiggle to be a consistent threat. Low throws give him some trouble.	Cole Beasley	Maye might be short, but he's not small. With a compact build and above average play strength for his size, he isn?t easily pushed around within his routes or before the catch. Maye has two traits that teams like in slot corners ­-- an ability to uncover quickly and a hyper-­competitive demeanor. While his production only spanned a single season, Maye looks the part of an NFL slot who could see action sooner rather than later.	\N	35	5.20999999999999996	k.j.-maye	\N
2555374	Ka'imi	Fairbairn	18	71	183	9.25	Thankfully Fairbairn only goes by Ka'imi, because his full first name is a mouthful: Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a. Fairbairn was the first Bruin to total over 100 points in each of his four collegiate seasons, saving his best season for last. The 2015 Lou Groza Award winner connected on 20 of 24 attempts in 2015, improving from his 18-for-22 mark in 2014. Fairbairn made two of three attempts from 50 yards out or more, including a 60-yarder against Cal. His ability to force touchbacks on kickoffs also catches the eyes of scouts (119 of 164 in 2014-2015, or 72.6 percent). A dual threat like that is coveted by special teams coaches across the league, making this Hawaii native a wanted man.	Incredible precision as a kicker. Made all 16 of his kicks this season from 40 yards and in and finished college with a streak of 41 straight makes from 35 and in. Lou Groza Award winner and Pac-12 all­-time leading scorer. Has a powerful leg. Nailed 60-yard field goal at the end of the half against Cal. Successful kickoff specialist as well with no kicks out of bounds and a touchback rate of 70 percent. Kicks with consistent rise trajectory.	Three of his four misses came in the fourth quarter. Kickoff hang time was average by NFL standards. Could cause major issues for jersey maker if he asks to go by given name Ka'iminoeauloameka'ikeokekumupa'a.	Blair Walsh	Fairbairn is the total package as a kicker. He is consistent from middle to long, has a strong leg to handle kickoffs and has never had a kick blocked thanks to his trajectory. Fairbairn should be drafted and step right into an NFL job.	\N	52	5.40000000000000036	kaimi-fairbairn	\N
2555375	Kevin	Peterson	14	70	181	8.625	While not the tallest or thickest corner in the draft class, Peterson might be one of the toughest, coming back from preseason knee surgery and playing through an ankle injury during his senior year to be named first team All-Big 12. The three-year starter actually got his first opportunity with the first team in the Cowboys' final game of his freshman season (20 tackles, two pass breakups). The former state high school 100-meter and 200-meter champion has produced in coverage (two interceptions, 11 pass breakups in 2014; one INT, six PBU in 2015) and is willing to mix it up on the outside, totaling 101 stops the past two years.	Smart player. Plays with field awareness and a high IQ. Responds from quarters coverage when he sees a safety needs help. Can flip hips and hit his top speed fairly quickly. Reads cues from receiver's eyes when deep ball is approaching and times his breakup attempt. Confident demeanor on the field and in coverage. Peeks in on quarterback from zone and is quick to help attack a slot throw. More aware than instinctive. Patient feet from press coverage and has adequate directional change. Not a big guy, but will mix it up against the run. Held his own against Josh Doctson and Corey Coleman.	His height is borderline but his frame is smaller than desired by NFL standards for outside corners. Allowed four broken tackles. Will sit down to challenge receivers underneath, but a step slow to recognize when to turn and chase. Recovery speed is average. Not a long corner and needs to crowd receivers to make plays on the ball. Physical receivers with size can put him on their hip. Gears get stuck in neutral when trying to burst forward from top of his backpedal.	\N	Peterson's confidence and football intelligence will grow on you after awhile. It's not always clean, but he finds ways to disrupt throws and man his position. Size limitations make a move inside as a nickel corner possible, but he has enough quickness and coverage savvy to stick on a roster.	\N	18	5.09999999999999964	kevin-peterson	\N
2555376	Lawrence	Thomas	10	75	286	10.125	Ranked in the top 30 of all recruits nationally coming out of Detroit, Thomas could have signed on with many different programs across the country. He stayed close to home, however, signing with the Spartans. Thomas redshirted in 2011 before splitting the next season between defensive end, fullback (he caught seven passes for 78 yards), and defensive tackle. He missed the first half of the 2013 season with a back injury, managing only on the year. Thomas proved healthy the following year, starting every game (12 at nose tackle despite his tall, athletic build), making 30 tackles, 4.5 for loss. MSU coaches moved him at defensive end for most of his senior season, resulting in career highs in tackles (38), tackles for loss (five), sacks (three), and pass break-ups (six). This improvement did not escape Big Ten coaches, who voted him honorable mention all-conference.	Outstanding athleticism for a man his size. Came in as a linebacker before moving to defensive line. Has muscular, well­-defined lower body with very little bad weight on his frame. Knee­-bender who comes off ball looking to strike a leveraged, upward blow. Good motor and is always working to improve his positioning with footwork and upper body strength. Hard to get him sealed and won?t quit on plays. Plays with good lateral bend and quickness. Unselfish and does dirty work asked of him to keep linebackers flowing. Can be a two­-down power end or has room for more weight to be play inside.	Hard worker, but lacking in overall production. Not much of a finisher on the other side of the line. Needs to get into blocker's framework more quickly with his hands. Aggressive in his "take ­on" but could improve with the quickness of his control and shed. Effort pass rusher who didn?t get home much with the Spartans. Uses a random spin move that gains little ground. Doesn't seem to rush passer with a plan.	\N	Worker bee type with the energy and athleticism to get you excited, but the lack of production that could keep him from becoming anything more than a rotational lineman. Teams will need to decide where to play him, but with a frame that carries so much good weight already, it isn't hard to imagine Thomas carrying 315 pounds for a full­-time spot inside. Keep in mind that Thomas played fullback as a freshman and teams might want to give him another look there.	\N	34	5.16999999999999993	lawrence-thomas	\N
2555377	Ross	Martin	18	69	183	7.375	When the Blue Devils landed the top-rated kicker recruit in the country for the 2012 season, they found a reliable scorer of which most other schools could only wish. Martin came three points short of clearing 100 points in each of his four seasons (106 in 2012, 97 in 2013, 107 in 2014, 120 in 2015). He missed only one extra point in his career (196 for 197) and made 84 percent of his field goal attempts even with a "down year" in 2013 (68.4 percent made, one of four from 40-49 yards). Martin made eight of ten attempts from 50 yards away or longer -- going four-for-four in 2015. He received All-ACC notice each year, as well, being voted honorable mention as a freshman and sophomore and consensus third team all-conference in his junior and senior seasons. Martin had kickoff duties in three of his four years, causing 72 touchbacks in 228 tries.	Considered a true technician in the kicking world. After a rough sophomore season, bounced back with outstanding accuracy over the next two seasons. Connected on 90.5 percent of his kicks in 2014 and 86.7 percent in 2015. Accurate from deep. Made 4-of-4 from 50-plus this season and has made 8-of-10 lifetime from that range. Has made 13-of-16 from 40-plus over the last two seasons. Has never had a field goal or extra point blocked. High school punter who could punt in a pinch. Known for mental toughness.	Might not have a leg big enough for NFL kick­off duties. Averaged just 59.9 yards per kickoff with a hang- time that has never ended up higher than 3.72 for any single season. Had two kickoffs returned for touchdowns this season. Missed twice in a game against Virginia Tech including potential game-winner with 1:04 left in regulation.	\N	Martin has been one of the most consistent kickers in college football over the last two seasons and has the ability to drive the ball with power and accuracy. He's also not afraid to get into the mix if a tackle needs to be made as witnessed by his 13 special teams tackles during his time at Duke. Martin has a strong leg as a field goal kicker, but needs to show he can drive his kickoffs with better length and hang time to improve his draft stock.	\N	2	5.15000000000000036	ross-martin	\N
2555378	Tavon	Young	14	69	183	9.125	Young went from high school football and track star (his 4x100-meter relay team won at the Penn Relays, set Maryland high school record) in the Washington, D.C. area to a starting corner for two games for the Owls as a true freshman, intercepting two passes. That success earned him a shared starting spot in his sophomore year (one interception, five pass break-ups). He became a playmaker as a junior, picking off opposing quarterback four times, leading the conference with 153 return yards and returning one interception for a touchdown. Young had surgery on his left knee before his senior year, but it didn't stop him from excelling in his final campaign with the Owls. His lack of statistical production kept him off all-conference teams in 2015 (41 tackles, five for loss, sack, seven pass breakups), but that was partially due to his ability to shut down opposing receivers.	Plays bigger and more physically than his listed height/weight. Drives through receivers with force at the point of the catch and can jar the ball free. Plays with winning ball skills. Grabbed four interceptions and had 14 passes defensed in 2014. Crowds receivers upfield and gets his head around to find the ball. Will violently rip and thrash at the ball to prevent a catch. Comfortable in bail coverage.	Teeny­-tiny. Gets grabby and starts to maul when running with big receivers. Flagged for five pass interference penalties this season. Doesn?t have twitch or fluid change of direction found in most smallish corners. Gets caught guessing on route recognition. Open to a side early and, at times, in the wrong direction. Feet are clunky when opening up to run with receivers. Narrow base from backpedal brings balance issues affecting his closing burst.	\N	Right off the bat, Young's lack of size is going to take him off draft boards for teams. While he's small and doesn't have as much quick­-twitch or high-­end speed to make up for it, he does play with decent ball skills and competes hard against consistently bigger targets. He will have to transition into the slot, but the quickness and separation ability of those NFL receivers could be challenging for Young to match.	\N	27	5.15000000000000036	tavon-young	\N
2555379	Tyvis	Powell	16	75	211	9.5	Powell just seems to make big plays in big games. He intercepted Michigan's two-point attempt to win the rivalry game as a redshirt freshman in 2013, He picked off a Hail Mary attempt by Alabama in the 2014 college football semifinal, ensuring the Buckeyes could go on to win the championship ? where he won Defensive MVP honors against Oregon (game-high nine tackles, pass break-up). Then he intercepted yet another pass in Ohio State?s win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. After that contest, Powell (who graduated in three and a half years) decided to take his game to the NFL. He played in all 14 games in that redshirt freshman season, starting five times (48 tackles, one interception). Earning the full-time starter spot in 2014, Powell made 76 tackles, two for loss, while intercepting four passes and breaking up four others. His play as a junior merited honorable mention All-Big Ten honors from coaches and media, as he led the Buckeyes with three interceptions and made 71 tackles on the year.	Has plus traits that lead to quality ball skills. Can run. Plays with range speed necessary to come from opposite hash and challenge the deep ball. Good leaper with high point springs. Twitch is there to break on in-­cutting routes and make a play. Has excellent hands and comes down with the interception when it is there for him. Posted seven interceptions over last two seasons. Able to track down runners turning the corner. Can get into action quickly against short, locker room and keeps things loose.	Despite his quality size, is not going to thump much. Waist-­bending head ducker into his tackles. Waits on running backs to get up to him rather than attacking downhill into them. Runners fall forward against him too often. Fails to make consistently squared contact as a tackler and was charged with 13 broken or missed tackles in 2015. Needs to trust his intelligence and instincts and jump more. Let deep ball responsibility get behind him when locking in on quarterback.	Kendrick Lewis	Doesn't appear to have the necessary physicality and tackle consistency to make a living around the box so he might be pegged as a single high safety with some man cover potential. Powell has the size and athleticism, but his instincts need some work and he has to become a more physical, downhill hitter. His overall intelligence and knack for making plays at critical times won't hurt his cause.	"He came out because he already has his degree and probably because he knows that his job would be much tougher next year with all that talent leaving.

2555380	Cyrus	Jones	14	70	197	9.125	Jones switched from receiver to cornerback for his sophomore campaign in 2013, and then blossomed into a second-team All-SEC pick by league media in 2014 (three interceptions, 13 pass deflections) in spite of a torn labrum in his hip, which was surgically repaired in the offseason. He started all 15 games his senior year, improving in coverage (two INT, seven PBU) and putting to rest concerns about his hip. Teams might be more interested in him as a punt returner, though, as his four touchdowns on a nation-leading 42 attempts in 2015 (12.6 yard average) came up one short of tying the FBS record. A domestic violence charge that was dropped against him last spring will make teams take a hard look at his character references.	Press corner with good build and strong lower half. Plus play strength. Confident and tough. Able to reroute and maintain positioning on receivers. From off coverage waits as long as he can before opening hips to turn and run. Willing to mix it up and likes to test receivers early in the game in an attempt to intimidate them. Plays receivers physically when they try to block him and is excellent in run support. Diligent in run contain duties. Scouts say he is well liked in the locker room and has some edge. Excellent return man. Blistered coverage units with four punt return touchdowns this year. Nicknamed "Clamp Clampington".	Doesn't check the height or length boxes teams want from outside cornerbacks. Run game awareness wanes when matched up in press coverage. Can be run up and off of run support. Not able to run with pure man­-cover speed. Allows receivers to uncover at the top of their routes and doesn?t have desired recovery quickness. Plays with average balance. Inconsistent finding ball in man coverage. Needs better awareness of receivers behind him in zone coverage. Big receivers can go up and over him in the red zone.	Steven Nelson	Has been a press corner who is comfortable in man coverage, but he will likely become a nickel cornerback who may be fitted to plenty of Tampa-2 coverage due to lack of speed. His ability to support against the run from the slot and return kicks could help drive his stock up beyond his actual cover abilities.	"He may need to get his Twitter game in check because I think he lets some of that stuff get to him, but it's just more fuel for his fire. He thinks everyone is always disrespecting him from media to the other team. I like him. You will never have to worry about his football character while he?s in the league." -- NFL executive	88	5.57000000000000028	cyrus-jones	\N
2555401	Marshaun	Coprich	2	68	207	\N	Few running backs in college football history have been as productive as Coprich, who cleared 5,200 rushing yards in his four years at ISU. His senior season almost didn?t happen, though, because he was caught trying to sell marijuana to an undercover police officer. His indefinite suspension from the football program was lifted after agreeing to a first-time offender program and community service. Once back on the field, Coprich took full advantage, totaling 1,967 rushing yards on a hefty 321 carries and scoring 23 times. As if he hadn't seen the ball enough, the Walter Payton Award finalist also caught 18 passes for 179 yards and a score. This was actually the second time Coprich had earned multiple All-American honors (AP, Walter Camp, AFCA, etc) for his talents, as he ran for a FCS-best 2,274 yards on 370 carries the previous year. Reaching the 2,000-yard mark was no new thing for the California native, as he covered 2,269 yards and scored 29 times as a senior in high school.	Muscular build with the competitiveness and toughness of a bigger back. Monster production over last two seasons with 4,241 yards rushing and 50 rushing touchdowns. Fluid hips with fleet feet. Lively feet in the hole can give second level tacklers the blues with his cut­-and­-go quickness. Big burst to separate from would­-be tacklers when he sees the door open. Zone runner with excellent vision and ability to immediately process changes in spatial relations. Able to "get lost" behind big offensive line and sneak into backside crevices. Has short­-area explosiveness to hit the chunk play. More than capable of creating running room and yardage for himself, but has adequate feel for when to accelerate into a crowded crease and finish. Has potential to be much more potent out of the backfield than he was asked to in college.	Monster production was logged against FCS competition. Showed indecisiveness when matched up against Iowa in the first game of the season. As zone runner, needs to press the line of scrimmage better. Doesn't sell play­-side run long enough before looking for cutbacks. Crowds pulling linemen and gets feet tangled too often. Lacks play strength to be an NFL­-level finisher as a runner. Quicker than fast. Teams might not trust his size against third-down blitz protection. Took plea agreement this summer for selling nine grams of marijuana to undercover officer and will still be on probation during the draft.	Jacquizz Rodgers	While he lacks height, he does not lack a willingness to make a living among the wide ­bodies as a zone-scheme runner. He has the elusiveness and burst to gain yards on the NFL level, but he is more of a volume­-carry runner than a change-of-pace back. Coprich has pass-catching potential and some kick returning in his background which could help his cause, but his prior arrest and current probation could make NFL teams a little nervous come draft time.	"He's not Darren Sproles, OK? I've heard that on the road and I don't see it. He is a good running back though. He's small but he runs well." -- NFC North area scout	241	5.25	marshaun-coprich	\N
2555381	DeAndre	Houston-Carson	16	73	201	9.125	Houston-Carson's 2014 season ended early due to injury (67 tackles, three interceptions in nine games), but he returned to form in 2015 -- winning consensus All-American honors at free safety after starting for three years at cornerback. He has prototypical size and plenty of speed to make plays in the deep secondary, intercepting four passes, returning one for a 94-yard score in 2015. Houston-Carson also possesses secure tackling skills which helped him lead the team with 109 stops on the year (4.5 for loss). "DHC" started as a redshirt freshman (55 tackles, one interceptions, seven pass breakups) and sophomore (62 tackles, 4.5 TFL, 2 INT, 11 PBU), too. Houston-Carson also presents special-teams prowess, with nine career blocked kicks and working as a gunner on coverage units.	Team captain. Combines a nose for the ball and a hot motor to fill up stat sheet. Slippery on his way to the ball with ability to weave through traffic and slip blocks. Plays with plus balance and is able to withstand contact from blocker and stay in the play. High­-end, charged up tackler with some explosion behind his pads a high­-end tackle production. Former cornerback with a background in man coverage. Has twitch and acceleration to match slot receivers out of their breaks. Plays with outstanding awareness of man and ball in zone coverage. Snared seven interceptions over last two years. Special teams gunner and overall ace with multiple coverage tackles. Gets out of his stance in a flash and has unique talent for blocking kicks including four punts in nine games in 2014.	Top-end speed to recover and drive from the hash towards the deep sideline is just average. Pad level can get too high robbing him of "stop now" tackle strength against running backs. Gets himself in trouble with some of his angles to the ball. Will take direct angles in his chase leaving little margin for error. Former cornerback still learning proper leverage as a run supporter at safety. Must learn to balance natural aggressiveness with necessary caution. Tapered frame may not be able to add much more weight.	Husain Abdullah	Houston­-Carson exudes confidence and football intelligence on the field and plays with the swagger of a D­-1 safety. In coverage, he is instinctive and responsive and trusts his eyes. While he is a ready, aggressive tackler, he still needs more beef on his frame and has to fine tune his angles to the ball to eliminate some of the big plays he has had a hand in. His physical and mental tools are starter's quality and his special teams talent should get him on the field right away.	\N	451	5.55999999999999961	deandre-houston-carson	\N
2555382	Jake	Ganus	12	73	231	\N	When the University of Alabama at Birmingham decided to discontinue its football program in December of 2014 (only to reinstate it soon thereafter), Ganus and other players on the team needed to find new homes. Ganus was basically a recruit again, as many schools were interested in having him in the middle of their defense. He started 10 games as a hometown hero at UAB in 2012 (63 tackles, 3.5 for loss, three pass breakups) and led the Blazers in tackles as a sophomore (93 tackles, eight for loss). Conference USA coaches voted him second team all-conference as a junior, as he again led the team with 70 tackles, 16.5 for loss including six sacks. Ganus picked up where he left off between the hedges, leading the team with 102 stops, five for loss, and intercepting two passes for the Bulldogs.	Was able to transition from C­onference-USA into the SEC and still play productive football. Praised for leadership ability on and off the field. Reads keys quickly and allows them to lead him to the ball. Tough and willing in the scrum. Heart is much bigger than his frame. Understands size limitations and will hide himself behind defensive line when he can. Looks for gaps to shoot into and attack the run early.	Small for an inside linebacker. Puffed up frame doesn't carry natural, functional strength. Was frequently smothered by Alabama's Ryan Kelly and the rest of the offensive line when they played. Unable to take on blockers and maintain his run fits. Average athlete with below-average speed in open spaces. Size and athletic limitation created too many missed and broken tackles. Sluggish in his drops into space vs. pass.	\N	Hardworking, undersized linebacker with good instincts and feel for his position, but might lack the necessary size and athleticism to execute at a level that would make him an NFL contributor.	"You would love to take his mindset and effort and put it into the body of more talented player. Good kid and I was there when he ended up proposing at midfield." -- NFC southeastern scout	83	4.79999999999999982	jake-ganus	\N
2555383	Jalen	Mills	16	72	191	9.125	In August, Mills fractured his left fibula (leg) and tore ligaments in his ankle. So he took a redshirt year, right? Wrong. He came back to play in six games, starting the final five at nickelback or safety (30 tackles, sack, three pass breakups). Mills' toughness wasn?t surprising given his strength as a tackler (62 stops in 2014) and the hands to create turnovers consistently (six interceptions in his first three years). LSU is known for the talent in their secondary, but that didn't stop Mills from starting at cornerback as a true freshman (57 tackles, two INT, five PBU) after Tyrann Mathieu was dismissed from the team. Though scouts will love his versatility, they have questions about an arrest for second-degree battery of a woman in the summer of 2014 (the charges were eventually reduced to a misdemeanor and he was assigned to a diversion program).	Four-year starter from deep, talented conference. Has slot cover ability. Hips are loose and he's able to open and mirror receivers from press. Uses crisp, controlled footwork out of his transitions. Locates the deep pass and can turn to make plays on the ball. Very aware from zone and handles his responsibilities without many busts. Good blitzer from the slot.	Thin­-waisted with a finesse frame.Takes iffy angles to the ball and isn?t as committed in run support as evaluators would like. Was not a productive tackler near the line of scrimmage. Mix and match traits might have him caught between slot corner and free safety. Lacks desired speed to carry vertical threats. Shows some confusion on combo routes.	Lamarcus Joyner	Mills was injured in the off­season and missed some time early in the season while recovering from a fractured fibula. Mills isn?t as physical as teams would like in run support but will do what he has to. In man coverage, he's rock ­solid until he has to chase vertical jack­rabbits and then it can get a little dicey. Mills will probably get action in sub ­packages early on, but might not be the every-­down player that some expect.	"I think he'll be a long-time player in the league because he has pretty good feel in coverage, but I also don't think he's a safety at all. He's a slot corner." -- AFC West scout	91	5.38999999999999968	jalen-mills	\N
2555384	Jared	Norris	12	73	241	10.125	Norris hopes to be the next Ute end/linebacker to enter the NFL (recent draftees include Joe and Paul Kruger, Koa Misi, Nate Orchard and Trevor Reilly). He played as a reserve as a redshirt freshman before starting seven games the following year (64 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks). Norris came into his own as a junior, receiving honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors with 116 tackles, 13 for loss, and four sacks. Even though his statistics weren't as impressive in 2015 (87 tackles, 6.5 for loss, one sack), league coaches named him second team all-conference because he showed stoutness between the tackles and a burst to the ball which portends a solid NFL career.	Team leader. Responds easily in change of direction. Quick lateral scrape for run fit positioning. Stays locked into ball carrier as he flows. Instinctive with a great feel for potential run lane choices as a play develops. Good reactive quickness to change gaps as play flow changes. Willing to meet force with force with taking on lead blockers in the hole. Stays busy all the time. Healthier in 2014 and produced better production in sacks and tackles.	Takes on with shoulder too often over hands and exposes his chest. Attempts to take on blockers with angles which can get him driven out of the gap. Plays and flows with elevated pad level creating issues redirecting against wash blocks. Needs more knee bend taking on second-level blockers. Very average chase speed. Straight line attacker who struggles to gather and make sudden change of direction in space as a tackler.	Zach Vigil	Norris isn't a plus athlete, but he has enough athleticism within the context of what he has to do on the field. His instincts help to guide him around the field, but he doesn?t have the technique or speed to be a high­-end playmaker. Norris looks the part of a backup WILL inside linebacker in a 3­-4 who has the potential to become an average starter down the road.	\N	80	5.36000000000000032	jared-norris	\N
2555385	Jeremy	Cash	17	72	212	10.5	The Blue Devils are looking for their first back-to-back drafts with a first-round pick in school history, and the former Ohio State Buckeye (he played five games as a true freshman in 2011 before transferring due to the change of coaches) has the sort of all-around game a team may covet enough to use an early pick to secure his services. He's a real presence in the box, as he showed during his sophomore season (121 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss, four interceptions) and in another outstanding year in 2014 (111 tackles, 10.5 for loss, 5.5 sacks, two picks, seven pass breakups). Cash was recognized as a second-team All-ACC player, as well as receiving second team All-American notice, in both seasons. In his senior year, Cash joined last year's first-round Blue Devil, guard Laken Tomlinson, as a consensus All-American by amassing 101 tackles, 18 for loss, 2.5 sacks, four pass break-ups, and three forced fumbles. The Bronco Nagurski and Jim Thorpe Award committees named him a finalist, and ACC coaches named him not only the conference Defensive Player of the Year, but also its top scholar-athlete. Unfortunately, Cash could not play in the team's bowl game against Indiana, sitting out the Pinstripe Bowl after having surgery on his right wrist.	Very big and very physical. All about it every time he steps inside the box. Eye-­popping impact tackle production with 33 of his 98 tackles in 2015 coming for gains of two yards or less. Finished with 326 tackles and seven forced fumbles over last three years. Long arms and big hands for the position. Looks like a small linebacker on the hoof. Comes diving off the edge to upend running backs before they hit the crease. Plays with big closing burst when he smells blood. Runs through targets with force and can separate receivers from the catch. Brings the fight to FBs and move TEs who try to come at him. Rabid run­-supporter when he's in attack mode.	Will struggle in space if asked to match up in man coverage. Plays with tight, stiff hips that limit sudden movements and change of direction. Can't flip hips and accelerate without intensive labor. Slow to drop into zone coverage with proper depth from line of scrimmage. Allows receivers to consistently uncover at the top of their routes. Will have to be protected in coverage. Scheme-limited. Had surgery this season for a broken wrist and will need to pass medical tests.	T.J. Ward	Deluxe run-supporter who has the closing burst and size to continue his impressive tackle production in the pros. Cash is much too stiff to be asked to make a living in coverage and any team considering him will likely view him as a box safety or hybrid player who is less about a defined position and more about physicality around the line of scrimmage.	"As long as you have a plan for him and play plenty of sub packages that let him play in the box, you will be fine." -- NFC scout	2	5.65000000000000036	jeremy-cash	\N
2555386	Sean	Davis	14	73	201	9.5	Davis speaks English, French, Chinese ... and the language of pain. At least that's what opposing ball carriers feel as he flies into them with reckless abandon. He was credited with more than 100 tackles in both his sophomore and junior seasons, and earned honorable mention All-Big Ten notice from league media by making 88 tackles, intercepting three passes, and ranking among the FBS leaders in forced fumbles with five in 2015. His versatility will certainly be coveted by NFL scouts, as will his athleticism, height/length, and tenacious play.	Big, broad frame with absolutely shredded physique. Showed mental toughness. Bounced back from awful Bowling Green game to make numerous plays against South Florida the next week. Has size to battle against move tight ends. Leaps and challenges aggressively on 50/50 throws. Grabbed three interceptions in 2015. Around the ball and in the mix. Posted 298 tackles over three years as a starter. Comes firing downhill with purpose when it is time to get help against the run. Looks to lay the wood to receivers and make them feel it. Second in the nation with five forced fumbles. Has played safety and cornerback.	At times, was disastrous in man coverage. Dinged for 614 yards receiving against him. Slow, upright backpedal and clunky when turning to run. Seemed to be too big and lacking in foot quickness needed to play cornerback. Flagged for four pass interferences, a late hit and a personal foul this year. Charged with ten touchdowns allowed over last two seasons. Missed tackle numbers are troubling with 40 over last three years. Allows too much separation and can?t click and close on throws.	Duke Ihenacho	Miscast this season as an outside cornerback, Davis battled through adversity and bounced back with ball production, tackles and forced fumbles. Davis has the ability to cover, but his strengths would best be utilized at safety where he has fewer man responsibilities and can be deployed near the line of scrimmage a little more often. Davis is an eventual starter at safety and a big backup at cornerback.	\N	5	5.40000000000000036	sean-davis	\N
2555387	Cody	Kessler	1	73	220	10.875	Physically, there's nothing special about Kessler; he possesses average size, an adequate arm, and fair athleticism (though he can effectively move within the pocket, which is important). The three-year starter could never crack Pac-12 first or second all-conference teams from league coaches, thrice finishing in the honorable mention category. However, Kessler was a finalist for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award the past two years because he moves the offense efficiently (3,826 yards, completed 69.7 percent of his passes; 3,536, 66.8 percent in 2015) and doesn?t turn the ball over much (39 touchdowns, five interceptions in 2014; 29 TD, 7 INT in 2015). In fact, Kessler owns the school record for career completion percentage at 67.5.	Baseline accuracy is pro quality. Never had a completion percentage lower than 65 percent as a three-­year starter. Will take what the defense gives them and keep the chains moving. Able to play "backyard catch" with open receivers underneath if defenses let him. Delivered from the pocket with a 70.4 completion percentage rate. Adequate arm strength. Good general sense of running an offense. Gets through progressions quickly. Has pocket feel with ability to climb the pocket to throw or escape from side doors when necessary.	Just a shade over 6-foot-1, which is smaller than teams like. Below average move accuracy as a passer. Ability to hit targets with catchable throws falls off the table when forced to scramble. Doesn't show poise or arm strength for deep routes needing additional time to develop. Footwork unsettled by perceived pocket pressure. Tends to hesitate over anticipating and trusting his arm. Low-risk, low-reward approach. Rarely makes the "wow" throws with velocity or touch. Feet look jittery when moving from read to read.	Aaron Murray	Can orchestrate an offense with confidence and accuracy when operating from a clean pocket, but doesn't appear to have the mentality of a player willing to take the risks necessary to strike with big plays often enough on the pro level. Kessler has moments where it is easy to like him on tape, but the traits and tape look more like those of a good, career backup than playoff starter.	\N	50	5.41000000000000014	cody-kessler	\N
2555388	D.J.	Reader	11	75	327	9.5	It's been a tough road for Reader since his father passed away in 2014, but if NFL scouts believe he is through that rough patch, they will have great interest in his ability to eat space in the middle of the defensive line. Just before the 2015 season began, Reader decided to leave the team for personal reasons. He returned in October, playing nine games on the year (13 tackles, 1.5 for loss). Expectations were high for Reader coming into the season because the Tigers lost a lot of talent to the NFL, and he flashed as a top reserve as a sophomore (43 tackles, five TFL, three sacks) and junior (27 tackles, 2.5 TFL, 1.5 sacks). Even as a freshman, who was highly-rated as both an offensive line and defensive line prospect out of high school, Reader earned a lot of playing time (40 tackles). He even played first base for the Clemson baseball in the spring of 2013, though his playing time was limited (0-for-3, three putouts in seven games).	Carries his 340 pounds fairly well on his stout frame. Almost always the low man at the point of attack. Able to leverage blockers and displace them. Plays with enough motor to chase the play down the field. If single blocked, will absolutely push the pocket as a rusher.	Rotational defensive lineman who lacked production. Gets initial push, but fails to shed blockers in time to make many tackles. Needs more coaching to improve his hands. Once he's on the move and engaged with a blocker, fails to consistently find the ball­carrier and ball.	Justin Ellis	Squatty, strong nose tackle who is able to push smaller centers around in phone booth battles, but unable to consistently be a disruptive force up front. Reader has the strength and potential to believe that his Senior Bowl flashes could turn into something more in the NFL, even though that might just be as a career backup.	"Just a plugger. He looks good at the Senior Bowl in one­-on­-one drills because he's stronger than these guys, but scouts tell me that in games he's limited." -- NFC defensive line coach	1	5.25	d.j.-reader	\N
2555389	Alex	Huettel	6	76	294	\N	\N	Shows good awareness when dealing with stunts and twists. Plays with a wide base most of the time allowing for better balance at contact. Above average with is ability to generate push and secure the defender on down­ blocks. Strikes with some pop on double teams opening running lanes.	Play strength is below average. Struggles to sustain his blocks and his lack of quickness off the snap puts him in second place early in the rep. Arm length is below average. Needs more nasty as a block finisher. Doesn?t show necessary athleticism or recovery ability to protect quarterback on NFL level. Lack of redirect could be an issues against NFL twists.	\N	Huettel is a 23­-year-old, four-year starter who has been a consistent and durable guard for Bowling Green. Unfortunately for Huettel, his lack of functional athleticism and play strength found the spotlight during drills at the Shrine Game practices and could hurt any draft chances he has.	\N	102	4.83000000000000007	alex-huettel	\N
2555390	Bralon	Addison	4	69	197	9.125	Addison was a first-team all-state quarterback in Texas his senior year, but it was clear his collegiate future was at the receiver position. He played wideout in the U.S. Army All-American game, and didn't miss a beat once in Eugene, making 22 catches for 243 yards and three scores as a true freshman. After fully adjusting to the college game, his sophomore season effort earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 accolades as a receiver (61-890, seven TD) and also averaged 14.1 yards per punt return, scoring twice. Addison?s ascension to the top of the college football world hit a roadblock in the spring of 2014, however, as he tore his ACL during a practice. The roadblock proved to be just a hiccup, though, as he returned to his explosive self in 2015, garnering second-team All-Pac-12 honors (63-804, 10 TD receiving; 12.6 average, one TD on punt returns) before deciding to take his quickness to the NFL.	Has the juice to be exciting after the catch. Averaged 6.1 yards after catch in 2015. Has potential run value on pitch plays and jet sweeps. Low center of gravity with smooth hip movement that makes change of direction subtle and simple for him. Plus acceleration from his stems and breaks to create workable separation window for quarterbacks. Steady hands with instant punt return value for NFL teams.	Was asked to run routes that lacked much complexity. More of an "athlete in space" than route ­runner. Had catch-­and­-run role with the Ducks without much asked of him pre­-catch. Averaged just 6.7 yards at the catch point. Missed 2014 with ACL tear. Appeared not to trust his repaired knee, passing on sharp cuts at times this year. Lack of catch radius requires greater accuracy. Too small to block on NFL level.	Josh Huff	Like many skill position players coming out of Oregon, Addison won't fit nicely into a positional box so there will be teams who pass him over regardless of how he performs at the combine. Addison does provide instant competition as a punt returner and a difficult cover for slot corners thanks to his ability to separate. Addison should be more confident with his knee next season and could end up outperforming his draft slot as a pro if he finds the right fit.	"He's like a toy you say you want from Christmas and then you never play with it. I can guarantee that if we were to draft him, our coaches would say they have to find a way to get him the ball and then he'll get cut or sit the bench because they can't figure out how to use him." -- NFC executive	48	5.45000000000000018	bralon-addison	\N
2555392	Chris	Brown	4	74	194	\N	Productive wide receiver prospects with track experience are intriguing to college recruiters and NFL scouts alike. Brown hits both categories, as he put up great high school numbers (33-532, 12 scores in just four games as a senior, losing time to a broken collarbone) and also starred on the track as a sprinter and jumper. In fact, he ran with the United States Junior track team. Brown started at least four games each year of his Notre Dame, improving his numbers each season. He caught 39 passes for 548 yards and a score as a junior before setting career highs with 48 receptions, 597 yards, and four touchdowns in 2015.	Steady and consistent over last three seasons. Has the ability to go up and get the ball and can make the occasional circus catch over smaller corners. Decent quickness off the snap and into his routes. Has build­up speed to sneak down the field against Cover­-2 looks. Runs crisp, quality routes and would benefit even more with better initial push to create panic in cornerbacks. Not overly physical as blocker, but does his job.	Thin frame. Will struggle against strong press­man corners. Hands are a little inconsistent. Has ability to make tough catches, but focus drops are a concern. Hand strength may be a culprit. Tends to get open due to design over separation quickness. Lacks fluidity in his adjustment to the downfield throw. Despite track in his background, didn't post explosive play count expected.	\N	Lanky second option at Notre Dame has a few traits that will keep him in draft discussions late on Day 3, but he doesn't have any standout qualities that he can hang his hat on.	\N	43	5.09999999999999964	chris-brown	\N
2555393	Chris	Jones	10	78	310	10.75	A late-bloomer on a middling high school team, Jones went from unknown prospect to a top 50 prospect nationally during his senior year, leading the squad to their first-ever playoff win. Despite late pressure from other top schools, Jones stayed true to MSU, which is near his home in Houston, Miss. He started three games as a true freshman, receiving honorable mention All-SEC honors from league media after tying for the team lead with seven tackles for loss. Jones had a sophomore slump, however, making just 26 stops, 3.5 for loss, and playing a reserve role the entire season. He rebounded in 2015, starting every game and making 44 tackles, 7.5 for loss, and 2.5 sacks, leading him to take his talents to the NFL as an early entrant.	Plays with tremendous natural power. Has strength in his hands and upper body to shed blockers without much effort when it?s time. Made to stymie downhill rushing attacks. Can battle through wash­-down blocks and work his way back into a tackle. High school hooper with sneaky lateral foot quickness. Uses quick feet and shoulder turn to leverage him into gaps for disruption. Flashes some occasional "quick win" hand work as pass rusher. Posted 34 quarterback pressures and 11.5 run stuffs. Has talent and strength to do what he wants on some snaps. Can generate a heavy pocket push when he gets some knee-­bend going. Sure­fire tackler with vision and agility to scrape down line of scrimmage and clean up runners working through line of scrimmage.	Will lock­out his long legs on too many snaps. Upright play style limits his leverage and balance against down­ blocks. Motor will run out of gas if he's forced to chase after play for very long. Average ball instincts. Change of direction can be inconsistent due to pad level. Flashes pass rush talent, but too content to lay on blockers when early rush fizzles.	Jordan Phillips	Ascending prospect whose production this season matched the flashes he showed on tape. Jones has the quickness off the snap to disrupt in the gaps and the strength to control the point of attack. Like Jordan Phillips, Jones plays with an elevated pad level which needs work. With a body type and skill set to play all along the defensive line in both odd and even fronts, Jones has a chance to come off the board early and make his mark in the pros.	\N	92	6.20000000000000018	chris-jones	\N
2555394	Daryl	Worley	14	73	204	10.25	This Philadelphia native finished his career on a strong note, giving him the confidence to enter the NFL draft as a true junior. He garnered first-team All-Big 12 honors after finishing among the nation's leaders with six interceptions and 12 pass breakups. He also made 49 tackles and forced two fumbles on the year, even though he didn't play in the Cactus Bowl with the team due to academic issues. Worley had led the team the previous year with three interceptions (also with 52 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four breakups), but faced trouble during the season. He was accused of assaulting a woman outside a nightclub in September, eventually pled no contest and received a six-month suspended sentence for his actions, which he said were in defense of his girlfriend. Worley missed two games due to a suspension. As a true freshman, Worley made his presence known on defense and special teams, starting five games, making 45 tackles, intercepting one pass, and breaking up five others.	Has height and arm length that every secondary coach loves. Instinctive and willing to operate outside of his zone. Won't lose the 50/50 battle very often. Sits down on receivers when ball is in the air and uses well-timed leap and outstanding hands to break it up or take it away. Credited with 12 pass breakups and six interceptions last season. Stellar reactive quickness with hands to pluck interceptions after undercutting routes. Redirects receivers with aggressive shoves. Decent finisher as tackler. Carries enough long speed to run with Baylor's Corey Coleman.	Doesn't have the loose hips or fluid feet to mirror and match in man coverage. The more layered the route, the more separation allowed. Passive in bail coverage allowing significant throwing run underneath. At times becomes pre­occupied with the vertical chase and fails to find deep ball headed his way. Would like to see more aggression from him play after play. Sits and waits in run support. Doesn't use size to overpower blockers and get into running backs early.	Tray Walker	Worley has good deep speed and excellent ball skills, but lacks the agility and hips to maintain his feel for receivers underneath. A move to a defense that employs more press and trail technique should benefit him and teams looking for range and instincts could try him at free safety. Worley's traits make him worthy of a Day 3 selection, but his success may be tied to his scheme fit.	\N	29	5.34999999999999964	daryl-worley	\N
2555395	Germain	Ifedi	6	78	324	10.75	Ifedi's build screams "NFL offensive lineman." He's started the past three seasons for the Aggies, starting out as a Freshman All-American right guard blocking for Johnny Manziel the year after the star quarterback won his Heisman Trophy. The following season he moved to right tackle, starting 11 games while missing two due to a sprained MCL. It was hoped that Ifedi could take over the left tackle position in 2015 after the departure of Cedric Ogbuehi to the NFL, but he instead stayed on the right side. Ifedi was named second team All-SEC by league coaches for his work last year. Instead of returning to the Aggies for 2016, he decided to join his brother Martin (who starred as a defensive lineman at Memphis) in the National Football League.	Outstanding length and overall mass. Has played guard and tackle and has ability to play either as a pro. Has athleticism to protect edge as a tackle and can step and catch late or sudden bursts inside. Good hand strength with ability to latch and lock ­up pass rushers when he lands punch inside the frame. At his best when getting on top of pass rushers with quick­-sets. Has reactive athleticism to respond to twists and blitzes. Uses length and foot quickness to open recovery doors that might slam on other linemen. Flashes hip explosion to torque defenders out of the hole as a run blocker. Has body control and change of direction talent to be a successful second level blocker. Nastier play demeanor than former Aggie tackle, Cedric Ogbuehi.	Offensive scheme limited ability to fire out. Tries to snatch with hands and hang on rather than securing blocks with leg drive. Inconsistent depth of pass sets opens up edge. Timing of combo blocks needs work. Gets in a hurry and doesn't always get first block secured. Uses more of a kick ­stomp than fluid kick­ slide. High pad level on down blocks limits leg drive to secure. Passive vertical pass sets allow easy pocket squeeze. Needs to eliminate habit of leaning into blocks. Too content to stalemate rather than dominate. Patience and discipline is a problem in pass protection. Lunges rather than letting the rep come to him.	Billy Turner	It wasn't long ago scouts were beating up former Texas A&amp;M tackle Cedric Ogbuehi about a disappointing season before he went 21st overall in the draft even with a torn ACL. NFL scouts see Ifedi as a guard, but a team may decide to try him at tackle before moving him inside. Ifedi has the tools and traits to become a good NFL offensive linemen if he can avoid the leaning and lunging that plagues him. A move inside combined with NFL coaching could unlock Ifedi's high ceiling.	"I think he should have gone back (to school). I like the talent, but he didn't put it together like I needed to see to give him a first two-round grade. I see him as a guard and not a tackle." -- NFC area scout	20	5.88999999999999968	germain-ifedi	\N
2555402	Matt	Skura	8	75	305	\N	A second-team USA Today All-American and consensus first-team All-ACC pick in 2015, Skura is a technically sound and athletic center with a bright NFL future. The four-year starter played some guard as a redshirt freshman, but his home is in the pivot, where his intelligence can be fully utilized. The 2014 third-team All-ACC selection's name isn't known by even more ardent college football fans, but he should be recognized nationally as one of the reasons head coach David Cutcliffe has risen the bar for the football program in Durham.	Has good size for a center with a well­-proportioned frame. Uses wide base in both run game and pass protection for balance. Possesses good core strength and body control both in his movements and through contact. Technically sound. Allows defenders to declare a side and then traps them on that side and secures the block. Pad level usually on point. Plays the game with intelligence and an understanding of angles and timing. Uses timing over athleticism to get best results on combo blocks. Keeps head back and arms extended in pass protection. Hand placement is solid and maintains feel for his target. Has a strong commitment to strength and conditioning.	Plays a more finesse­-based game over power. Doesn't generate much push against quality strength across from him. Has just average athleticism. Angles and technique work have to be just right or secure blocks will be a challenge. Average to below-average quickness off snap. Is not at his best when asked to work in open spaces. Reactive movement could use work against counter moves in pass pro.	Russell Bodine	Extremely cerebral in his approach and uses his instincts and technique to maximize his overall talent. While Skura might not be the most athletic center, he does play with desired body control and functional strength for the position and he doesn't take many bad losses on a rep. His intelligence and technique work give him a shot to become an NFL starter, and he played guard as a freshman so he might have some two-position versatility.	\N	2	5.25999999999999979	matt-skura	\N
2555396	Jaden	Oberkrom	18	74	186	8.5	Oberkrom (Oh-ber-chrome) has been everything you'd want in a kicker during his four-year stint with the Horned Frogs. He's made 99 percent of his extra points (214-216), 79 percent of his field goal attempts (a career best 21-25 in 2015), converted from distance (3-3 from 50 yards away in 2015, with a long of 57 yards), placed kickoffs into the end zone regularly (62.4 percent touchback rate as senior), and made clutch kicks (game-winner against West Virginia with no time on the clock as a true freshman). The Big 12?s all-time leader in field goals made (79) set a conference record with six in one game in 2012. Oberkrom was a three-time semifinalists for the Lou Groza Award as the nation?s top kicker and earned all-conference recognition all four years: honorable mention in 2012 and 2013, first team in 2014, and second team in 2015.	Four-year starter from a family of soccer players. Decorated kicker for high­-end, Big 12 squad. Has a history of making kicks in the clutch. Has NFL­-caliber leg for distance field goals. Made 7-of-8 from 40-plus and 3-of-3 from 50-plus this season. Saw his highest touchback numbers of his career at 60.9 percent.	Missed two kicks inside of 30 yards this season. Inconsistent with kick trajectory. Over last two seasons has had a total of four FGs/PATs blocked. Needs to improve kickoff hang­ time.	\N	Oberkrom kicks with good technique and torque to generate impressive distance from a thin frame. While he has shown that he has enough leg to compete for a job in an NFL camp, it is his improved accuracy that might be the difference-maker.	\N	63	4.95000000000000018	jaden-oberkrom	\N
2555397	John	Lunsford	18	73	214	10.125	Lunsford finished as the FCS career leader with 12 field goals of 50-plus yards made during his four-year stint as the Flames' placekicker. He went from an all-conference performer as a freshman (8-12 FG) to being named a first-team All-American by multiple outlets in 2014. He made five of six attempts from 50 yards-plus as a junior, and then nearly matched that as a senior with a four-for-six mark. During those two years, he made three 57-yard field goals and a 60-yarder. Lunsford struggled a bit on kicks from 40 to 49 yards, converting only eight of 23 attempts from that distance, and he had eight kicks blocked during his career. However, NFL special teams coaches will at least consider him as a kickoff specialist, as he forced touchbacks on about 60 percent of his kickoffs (145 of 243).	Strong leg. Boomed a 60-yard field goal with 1.8 seconds on the clock to tie the game against Richmond in 2014. Had two makes from 57 and one from 56 this season. Creates touchbacks on kickoffs.	Accuracy has plagued him throughout his career making just 60.8 percent of his field goals over four years. Made just 13 of 24 kicks in 2015. Struggles badly with accuracy from 40­-49 yards making just eight of 20 during his career.	\N	Big legs are nice, but if Lunsford can't make field goals at a substantially higher clip, his dreams of being an NFL kicker are unlikely to be realized unless he is to be considered a kickoff and long field goal specialist.	\N	262	4.70000000000000018	john-lunsford	\N
2555398	Josh	Woodrum	1	75	231	9.25	As a redshirt freshman, it look Liberty coaches exactly two games to stick Woodrum into the fire. In the third game of the 2012 season, he took over the starting job and didn't let go (save two games in 2014 he missed with an injury). Now he?s the Flames' career record holder in passing yards (10,266), completions (833), and attempts (1,304). The three-time second team All-Big South selection and team captain is an efficient passer, throwing for 61 touchdown versus 30 interceptions in his career. The Flames were only 6-5 under head coach Turner Gill in 2015, but Woodrum's play help them beat two top 10 teams at home in Montana and Coastal Carolina, the latter victory closing out the quarterback?s collegiate career.	Has necessary NFL size. Steps and drives his throws. Can put the ball on top of receivers with some pace. Accurate with blitz reads and gets ball to hot reads quickly. Can sense when corners are looking to jump routes and will pump fake his way into a cleaner throw. Has enough arm to operate in a more aggressive, vertical offense.	Stiff and limited outside of the pocket. Has wind­up with a short­-armed release. Aims his throws. Drive accuracy is marginal. Over­-the-­top release with downward trajectory creates low, challenging catches. Lacks consistent accuracy and touch. Panics and rushes throws when he sees blitz coming. Lacks improvisational thinking. Slow to see throws come open over the middle and will run receivers into traffic.	\N	Woodrum has enough size and arm to get a scout's attention, but his average accuracy and lack of touchdown production relative to his passing attempts is disappointing. Woodrum might be worth grooming, but he is a pocket passer who is missing the field vision usually associated with those types of "stash" prospects.	\N	262	4.79999999999999982	josh-woodrum	\N
2555399	Keyarris	Garrett	4	75	220	\N	Garrett looks the part of an NFL receiver, and is the nephew of former Baylor and Atlanta Falcons receiver/return specialist David Mims (whose son, David Mims II, is a 2016 draft prospect out of Texas State and played with Garrett in high school). His career with Tulsa has had its ups and downs, starting with an injury-filled freshman campaign (six games, two catches for 10 yards), but he bounced back by earning second-team All-Conference USA in 2012 (67-845, nine TD receiving). Unfortunately, Garrett couldn?t build on that momentum, losing the 2013 campaign lost to a compound fracture in his left leg suffered in the second week of the season (7-68 receiving). His first year back from the injury was good enough to get him back on NFL scouts radars (47-698, five TD, missing two more games due to injury). He fulfilled his promise in his final year with the Golden Hurricane, leading the nation with 1,588 receiving yards and finishing in the top ten with 96 receptions while scoring eight times. Garrett garnered first-team All-Conference USA accolades for his efforts.	Long­-limbed and tall with sinewy build. Extreme arm length providing unique catch ­radius. Can go up and high-­point the ball over most cornerbacks he faced. Able to stack cornerbacks and keep them out of the deep throw once he gets over top of them. Long strides and build­up speed seems to catch cornerbacks off guard on vertical routes. Had 28 catches of 20-plus yards in 2015.	Long legs hinder get­-off against press. Takes awhile to get into his routes and is unable to sink hips and explode out of his breaks to create separation. Has extremely small hands for a receiver his size. Charged with 13 drops over last two years. Struggles mightily to finish contested catches. Routes are basic and somewhat sloppy underneath. Too often waits on throws rather than working back to them.	Rodney Smith	Garrett's production combined with his exceptional length should catch the eyes of NFL general managers right off the bat, but tape study exposes his issues with route quickness underneath and securing contested catches. Garrett probably won't post a blazing 40-yard dash at the combine, but he does have some vertical talent and will have to prove to teams that he can become a consistent finisher and a big-play threat in order to become an NFL contributor.	\N	118	5.19000000000000039	keyarris-garrett	\N
2555400	Maliek	Collins	10	74	311	9.5	Not only was Collins an outstanding football player at Kansas City Central High School (first-team all-state with 43 tackles for loss and 15 sacks as a senior), but a championship wrestler who won a state title at 48-0 in his final year. That combination is gold to NFL scouts, who love defensive linemen who have used their hands to grapple on the mat as well as the gridiron. Collins contributed in his first year on campus in 2013, playing all 12 games and starting the team's bowl game (12 tackles, two for loss, one sack). His star power began to shine in his sophomore year, garnering second team All-Big Ten accolades and team Defensive co-MVP with 45 tackles, 14 for loss, and 4.5 sacks. Though he started 12 of 13 games in 2015, Collins' production dropped: 29 tackles, seven for loss, 2.5 sacks. Big Ten media members and coaches alike still felt that he made enough plays to earn third-team all-conference honors.	Explosive get­-off with good pad level. Has exceptional lateral movement and overall athleticism for the position. Moved around defensive line as rusher and allowed to stand to maximize athleticism as twister. Good coordination between hands and feet. Strong jump­ step and club move inside is his go-­to rush. Flashes an impressive ceiling when it's clicking for him. Initial quickness opens door for disruption. Plus motor with active hands.	Has very little scheme or position flexibility. Ends up on the ground all the time. Impact production doesn't match the athletic ability and talent. Square rusher missing hip swivel and upper body turn to improve penetration. Comes flying in as pass rusher on twists, but doesn't have workable counter­attack ready. Unable to stack and anchor against double teams. Doesn?t have play strength to fight back against redirect blocks.	Henry Melton	Three­-technique with impressive athleticism and movement skills, but a lack of play strength to hold up at the point of attack. Collins needs to play for a defense that allows him to play up the field and should benefit from pass rush work with NFL coaching and teammates. Collins should test well which could push him way up the draft board, but his floor is lower than many of the defensive tackles in this draft.	\N	16	5.59999999999999964	maliek-collins	\N
2555403	Mekale	McKay	4	76	207	9.5	McKay, a former high school hoops star who received interest from Louisville and Kentucky to play that sport, transferred from Arkansas after his freshman season to Cincinnati to be closer to an ailing grandmother. The NCAA allowed waived the transfer year in his case, so he was able to play immediately for the Bearcats. He made a solid contribution to the Razorbacks in his only season there, starting 10 times and catching 21 passes for 317 yards and two scores. All McKay did in the wide-open UC offense was average over 30 yards a catch (16-485) with seven touchdowns in 2013. His junior (44-725, eight TD) and senior (27-507, two scores) seasons displayed similar big-play ability to NFL scouts despite his playing for a team that spreads the ball around to six or seven receivers every game.	Gets the most out of his 6-foot-3 frame when the ball is in the air. Uses well-timed leaps to go up and over smaller defenders and has a feel for the "post-up" game. Clever hand usage to create late separation on deep throws. Works his way back to the catch. Able to accelerate upfield quickly off of his stutter-step release versus press coverage. Willing to stick his nose in as a blocker and has the frame and hand placement to wall defender off and away from making the play.	Production took a dive in 2015 even when healthy. Route running is dull, lacking tight, crisp cuts. One-speed routes put cornerbacks at ease and allow them to crowd the routes. Needs to do better job with vertical sell to back defenders off. The struggle is real if he doesn't get clean release off line of scrimmage. Once defender gets into his chest, it is usually over. Hands have been consistently inconsistent with a drop rate of more than 11 percent for his career.	Dezmin Lewis	McKay was a "one to watch" type of prospect headed into 2015, but failed to build on that buzz this season. While his size is appealing and could get him drafted if he runs a good 40-yard dash, his potential issues against press coverage combined with below average hands could be quite a stumbling block.	"Don't like the hands, don?t like routes and I don't think he plays as fast as his timed speed. He should be better than he was this year." -- NFC regional scout	56	5.05999999999999961	mekale-mckay	\N
2555404	Nila	Kasitati	6	75	317	10.5	Samaje Perine set a FBS record with 427 yards rushing against Kansas in 2014, in part thanks to the blocking of Kasitati (pronounced kah-sih-TAH-tee). The big man pulled around the left side from his right guard position to cut off inside defenders, drove his man off the ball, or used his feet to seal the hole for Perine to bull through. He was just a part-time starter as a junior, though he still received honorable mention All-Big 12 notice. Kasitati was named first team all-conference in 2015 after starting all 13 games at the right guard spot. His medicals will have to check out at the combine for him to be drafted in the middle rounds, as he had surgery on a heart arrhythmia in the summer of 2012.	Thick, strong legs with broad shoulders. Has some initial power and ability to match the challenge when lined up against a player with strength. Looks for work and blocks through the whistle. Plays with toughness and some nasty. Able to pick up games by defensive linemen and isn't easily spooked by blitz bluffing linebackers. Maintains his base when mirroring in pass pro. Hand placement is generally good. Patient in pass sets willing to wait for rusher to make his move rather than lunging after him.	Can be very slow out of his stance. Marginal lateral quickness makes for inconsistent cross­-face blocks and short pulls. Arm length looks like an issue on tape. Needs to play with more pop in his hands. Block sustaining would benefit from bringing his feet and crowding defender after contact. The further away from home base he is forced to move, the more limited he becomes. Straight-line blocker with limited change of direction ability.	\N	Steady right guard with an NFL-­ready frame and good toughness for the interior. Kasitati has the power to stalemate his base blocks and secure his down ­blocks, but he has some athletic limitations that could limit his scheme fit. Kasitati may or may not be drafted, but he has enough ability to compete for a backup spot on an NFL roster.	\N	17	5.12000000000000011	nila-kasitati	\N
2555405	Peyton	Barber	2	70	228	9.375	As a freshman, Barber was diagnosed with a learning disorder that, along with ADHD, had hampered him since middle school. Since his father had the same issue, Peyton received the support he decided both from his family and the university tutor system and did well in the classroom. He only saw the field in six games as a redshirt freshman in 2014, running the ball 10 times for 54 yards. But after a sophomore season where he chugged out 1,017 rushing yards and 13 scores (on a workhorse-like 238 carries), Barber decided to follow the path of his second cousins, Marion and Dominique Barber, to the NFL.	Good thickness through his lower body with an ability to drop his pads and hit it downhill when he's near the end zone. Has vision to recognize running crease development. Can weave from cut-to-cut on second level. Flashes good lateral agility to jump­-cut his way into better running lanes when interior traffic is a problem. Intelligent with ability to learn NFL playbook quickly. Makes sound decisions in blitz pick­ups. Needs technique work, but has capability to handle himself in pass protection. Had the lowest "stuff rate" (rushes for 0 yards or less) of any of the top runners in the SEC at 10.1 percent (Leonard Fournette was 15.3 percent).	Entirely too much dancing when approaching line of scrimmage. Will make juke­-step rather than trusting the crease and mashing the gas downhill. Grinder with limited second level shake to keep the run going. More elusive near the line of scrimmage than in open field. Needs to play with greater decisiveness on the next level. Better pre-­cut movement can help him set­up blocks more effectively. No "wow" factor.	Josh Robinson	Redshirt sophomore who came out early, in part, due to depth of next year?s draft class at running back. Barber proved to be steady and productive with plus vision and a nose for pay dirt, but was missing the decisiveness and explosion that teams like from featured backs. Barber has the size and enough wiggle to make an NFL roster, but his draft value might be determined by his ability to help on special teams and on third downs.	\N	90	5.12000000000000011	peyton-barber	\N
2555406	Raphael	Kirby	12	72	236	9.875	The Hurricanes expected Kirby to continue his ascension to all-conference playmaker in 2015, but a right knee injury suffered against Virginia Tech ended that dream prematurely. The team captain already had 44 tackles on the year when the injury occurred, nearly matching his total from 2014, when he started every game (54 tackles, two interceptions, two pass-breakups). The former four-star prospect (18.5 sacks at Stone Mountain High in Georgia) played a limited role, mostly on special teams, in his first two years with Miami, making 26 tackles, 2.5 for loss in 20 games.	Keeps playing through blocks and will come off to make a diving tackle. Plays with good down and distance recognition. Has reactive athleticism and agility to change directions quickly and work back into counters and cutbacks. Has good backpedal into space and will mirror quarterback?s eyes in coverage. Good closing quickness to the perimeter. Team captain and willing worker on special teams.	Tore ACL mid­season which will prevent him from working out at the combine. Average athleticism for the position. Tends to drift downhill when he scrapes and gets hung up in the trash. Uses shoulder to take on blockers rather than hands. Undersized and can be dislodged from run fit by lead blockers. Takes questionable angles to the ball losing run fits. Average reaction off snap puts him in cross­ hairs of second-level blockers.	\N	Undersized with average athleticism, Kirby is a try-­hard linebacker with good football character but only moderate production at best during his time at "The U." While I wouldn't rule out his chances of battling for a roster spot, his ACL tear could make being drafted an uphill climb.	\N	23	5.12999999999999989	raphael-kirby	\N
2555407	Robby	Anderson	4	75	190	\N	\N	Has tremendous bounce to climb the ladder and snatch the pass at its high point. Has excellent balance and body control to make the circus catch. Plays faster than his timed speed and has decent short area quickness. Well-liked by coaching staff and considered a good teammate. Showed ability to get some separation during Shrine Game practices.	Rail-thin frame. Missed 2014 season after being suspended for academic purposes and elements of his game fell off in 2015. No such things as easy catches. Able to make the circus catch, but struggled badly with focus drops. Average long speed and getting deep on double moves and through play­-action.	\N	Tall, but rail thin with a 2015 season that featured Anderson's ability to make the incredible catch sandwiched with way too many drops. His separation quickness and overall speed doesn't jump off the tape, so he needs an impressive combine.	\N	27	4.92999999999999972	robby-anderson	\N
2555408	Roberto	Aguayo	18	72	207	9.875	What do you do for an encore after winning the Lou Groza Award as the nation's top kicker? How about lead the nation in field goal percentage one year, and then become the first three-time All-American to play for the 'Noles since Deion Sanders? Not bad. Among his other accomplishments, Aguayo was a major player in the team?s 2013 national championship, setting FBS records with 157 points scored and 94 point after tries without a miss. He also made 21-of-22 field goal attempts on the year. The three-time first team All-ACC pick by league coaches set a conference record by making 198 straight extra points ? every one in his storied career. Aguayo led the NCAA in field goal percentage in 2014, making 27-of-30 attempts, though he fell off a bit as a junior (21-26, just 5-for-10 from 40 or more yards away). He had 47 touchbacks in 84 kickoffs in 2015 (56 percent, up from 51 percent in 2014 and 37.5 percent in 2013), presenting leg strength NFL special teams coaches covet.	Was Mr. Automatic during Florida State's successful run from 2013­-2014 and connected on 88.5 percent of his field goals during his career. Never missed a field goal from 39 yards and in during his three years at Florida State going 46-of-46. When it's time to tackle, he leverages returners against the sideline and has speed and athleticism to make the tackle. Leg strength on kickoffs improved with each year. Has outstanding 4.09 kickoff hang time. Unfazed by the moment.	Saw his accuracy dip in 2015. Made just 5-of-9 field goals from 41 yards and beyond. Will occasionally lose track of a kickoff and knock it out of bounds. Only attempted six kicks of 50-plus yards during his career. While quality of kickoffs have improved, still doesn't have a booming kickoff leg.	Graham Gano	Burst onto the college scene by winning the Lou Groza Award as a redshirt freshman and performing at a high level during the Seminoles' run under Jameis Winston. Aguayo is considered an accurate, clutch kicker but with average leg strength. Aguayo is the first kicker to declare early for the draft since Sebastian Janikowski and is expected to be drafted, though not as early as "Seabass" was.

2555409	Ryan	Malleck	5	76	247	9.375	Though never a No. 1 option in the Hokies' offense, especially the explosive Bucky Hodges earning touches of his own the past couple of seasons, Malleck presents enough ability to make a go at a professional career. He was a starter for the final 25 games he played, contributing as a pass receiver in both his junior (24-195, two TD) and senior (21-289, two TD) seasons. Malleck had hoped to be a largest factor in the passing game in 2013 after a redshirt sophomore year where he started seven times, catching 17 passes for 174 yards, but a torn left rotator cuff and labrum in preseason practice sidelined him for the year.	Intelligent against zone coverage. Sinks into quality soft spots and uses strong, reliable hands to finish the catch. Has had just one drop over his last two seasons. Uses body to shield man coverage from the throw. Aggressive runner after the catch. Not a bulldozer as a blocker, but gets into his target and shows some block sustaining potential.	Nothing stands out with his burst off the ball and he takes too long out of his breaks limiting ability to separate. Doesn't have blocking power to balance out his below-average play speed. Will need to play with stronger lower half as an NFL run blocker.	\N	Has the size to be an NFL "Y" tight end, but needs to keep working on his blocking since that will be how he earns his chance on the field. Malleck is competitive, if limited, in the passing game and could hear his name called on the third day if he puts together a decent combine.	\N	28	5.16000000000000014	ryan-malleck	\N
2555410	Stephen	Anderson	5	74	230	9.25	Even though Anderson started his career at Cal as a walk-on, he's hoping to add himself into the list of Bears tight ends making an impact in the NFL including former teammate Richard Rodgers, Craig Stevens, and, of course, future Pro Football Hall of Famer Tony Gonzalez. Anderson redshirted in 2011 and played just four games without a catch the following year. Then he crept into the Cal offense by starting five games as a sophomore, catching 14 passes for 125 yards. With Rodgers off to the Green Bay Packers as a third-round pick in 2014, Anderson became a reliable target for quarterback Jared Goff. His production as a junior (46-661, five TD) and senior (41-474, two TD) earned him honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors each season.	Better quickness into his routes off the line of scrimmage than most at his position. Opens quickly as a presentable target in space. Can body up to protect the throw against converging linebackers. Decent athlete who can get some separation from linebackers with his quickness alone. Was able to get open for potential big plays, but quarterback Jared Goff didn't see him. Used as field stretcher for underneath work by other targets.	'Tweener without a real position. Blocks like a big receiver and is undersized to handle in­line duties. Routes can be flat and easy to recognize for defenders. Legs and arms pump like crazy into routes, but doesn't create proper leverage points.	\N	Anderson will struggle to carry enough weight to become a full-­time, move tight end and his blocking simply isn't trustworthy. However, the tape shows enough potential as a matchup tight end to monitor his combine and pro day. While I consider Anderson to be a long ­shot to make a roster, NFL scouts believe he has a legitimate shot.	\N	47	5	stephen-anderson	\N
2555411	Steve	Longa	13	73	241	9.75	Growing up in Cameroon, Longa's first love was world football. But upon reaching the U.S., he gave American football a try. By the time he left Saddle Brook High, he was a prized recruit. Four years later, he's among the best linebackers in the country. As a redshirt freshman, Longa started all 13 games at middle linebacker for the Scarlet Knights, sharing the team's Defensive MVP honors (123 tackles, 7.5 for loss, three sacks, two forced fumbles, four pass break-ups). He moved to the weak side in 2014, once again leading Rutgers with 102 tackles (4.5 for loss, two sacks) and stayed at that position for an honorable mention All-Big Ten junior season (117 tackles, five for loss, two sacks). Having put up three 100-tackle seasons and seeing the departure of his head coach, Kyle Flood, Longa declared for the 2016 NFL Draft as an early entrant.	Has looked for action from his first day on the field. Notched over 100 tackles in all three years at Rutgers (338 total). Has four contests with 10 solo tackles or more this season. Flows downhill and takes efficient angles to running lanes. Collides squarely with target and wraps up. Quality finisher with a high winning percentage as a tackler near the line of scrimmage. Allowed just two broken and seven missed tackles all year. Has nose for run play development that helps him stay ahead of climbing linebackers. Motor never turns off.	Undersized linebacker with marginal play strength and frame. Has to stay punch-­ready to stay clean or he can get smothered by size. Has to work overtime to disengage from blocks. Half-strider missing plus chase speed to walk down runners turning the corner. Bites down hard on play-­action. Inconsistent in man coverage and allows too much catch space from zone. Might lack gap­ control necessary to play in the middle.	Mike Hull	Downhill attacker with a nose for the action. If he doesn't put together exciting combine test scores, teams will have to weigh his consistent production and ability as a tackler against his lack of size and coverage skills. Longa could factor in as an eventual starter at some point, but he might have to prove himself on special teams early in his career to earn his initial roster spot.	"I don't think he's going to test all that well at the combine and his size will work against him, but I love his toughness and production. He's a backup with some special teams ability, but it wouldn't shock me if he ended up working his way into a starter's role at some point." -- NFC director of scouting	25	5.26999999999999957	steve-longa	\N
2555416	Christian	Hackenberg	1	76	223	\N	Hackenberg's junior year did not go quite as expected, but he still wound up as the school's all-time leader in passing yards (8,457) and touchdowns (48). The son of a former University of Virginia football player was a three-year starter, answering the bell for all 38 games in his career. Hackenberg lived up to his recruiting hype by being named the Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2013, as well as a Freshman All-American (2,955 passing yards, 20 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions). His play was not as efficient in his sophomore year (2,977 yards, 12 TD, 15 INT), but his MVP performance in the Nittany Lions' double overtime Pinstripe Bowl win over Boston College led many to think he was on his way to stardom. Unfortunately, Hackenberg's play in 2015 was uneven, at best, as he completed just 53.5 percent of his passes for 2,525 yards, 16 touchdowns and six interceptions. He finished the season leaving the team's TaxSlayer Bowl loss to Georgia due to a right shoulder sprain, and then announcing his intention to declare for the 2016 NFL Draft.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	38	5.58999999999999986	christian-hackenberg	\N

He again excelled as a senior, earning second-team Walter Camp All-American honors and second team All-Big 12 accolades after finishing among the nation?s leaders in several categories (3,573 passing yards, 31 touchdowns, 10 interceptions; 612 rushing yards, 10 rushing scores) despite missing time with an ankle injury. Boykin was also a finalist for the Davey O'Brien (2014, 2015), Manning (2014, 2015), Unitas Golden Arm (2015), and Walter Camp Player of the Year (2014) awards during his illustrious career. Unfortunately, Boykin's career at TCU ended on a sour note, as he was arrested for punching an officer during a bar fight in San Antonio, where he was supposed to lead the team in the Alamo Bowl against Oregon. He was suspended for that game due to the incident (though the Horned Frogs came back from a 31-0 hole to win 47-41), and will have to answer to NFL teams about his lapse of judgement.	Quick ball­-handling with arm talent to get the throw out cleanly and accurately from a variety of arm slots. Generally throws with necessary ball placement and hits what he aims for. Has deep ball arm to fling it 60 yards off his back foot and can rip it into a tight window underneath. Throws with some anticipation and touch. More pocket elusive than any quarterback in this draft. Absolute Houdini who can escape the most precarious situations and escape with chunk rushing yardage or a completed pass. Has 25 rushes over 15-plus yards over last two years.	Falls below desired height for NFL quarterbacks and hand size is right on borderline. Fumbled 19 times over last three years (but lost just four). Tends to stick with pre­-snap decision and forces the issue with primary target. Hesitant to throw receivers open from man coverage in deep middle. Velocity is all upper body with very little step and follow throw. Antsy to leave pocket when pocket slide and poise would suffice. Needs to learn how to slide outside pocket. Suspended for Alamo Bowl after breaking curfew and being arrested for felony assault of an officer in connection with previous bar fight that night.	Tyrod Taylor	He might be written off as too small or a "system quarterback", but he has shown tremendous growth as a passer and leader while building an impressive resume over the last two seasons. Boykin throws with some anticipation and has the arm talent and mobility to warrant a late-round pick even if he will need extended work learning to read defenses. There is a chance that his arrest at the end of the year could prevent him from being drafted.	"Look, man, do you know South Dallas? He's from there so he's got some edge. He's a good dude though. He got caught up and paid the price. No character problems there to me." -- NFC South area scout	63	4.91999999999999993	trevone-boykin	\N
2555413	Trevor	Davis	4	73	188	\N	Most people spend their lives trying to get to Hawai'i at least once, but Davis decided that two years in the Rainbow State was enough, especially after head coach Norm Chow was let go. He had started 10 times in his two years with the Warriors, racking up 45 receptions for 601 yards and five touchdowns. After sitting out a redshirt season in 2013, Davis became an all-purpose threat for the Bears, making plays as a receiver (24-399, five TD) and returner (424 kickoff return yards, 70 punt return yards) as a junior. He had 40 receptions in 2014 (one of six players hitting that mark) that covered 672 yards and two scores, and had 686 kickoff return and 45 punt return yards as well. Those sort of receiving/return numbers won't go unnoticed by NFL scouts.	Quality return man specializing in kick­offs with two touchdowns under his belt while at Cal. Former high school long jumper and sprinter with build­up speed to challenge deep safeties from the hash. Competitive runner after the catch with ability to make defenders miss and finish his runs with some authority. Hands are adequate.	Track speed doesn't translate underneath. Needs runway to get going and can't hit jets out of his breaks for separation. Needs to improve hard vertical push to clear space for comebacks and outs. One­-speed, rounded routes need work. Struggles to release cleanly against quality press coverage.	\N	Wiry catch-­and-­run specialist whose NFL value rests in his return ability. Davis could be a difficult sell because he's not an NFL­-ready receiver, but a big combine could create late-round interest or elevate his stock as a priority free agent.	"He's a pretty good returner. I don't see him being drafted, but he could make a team as a return man and last receiver on the depth chart." -- NFC West scout	47	4.91000000000000014	trevor-davis	\N
2555414	Willie	Henry	10	75	303	10.875	Though Henry had 10 sacks playing for Ted Ginn, Sr. at powerhouse Glenville (Ohio) High, he was not highly regarded in recruiting circles. Each year we played for the Wolverines, however, he showed the improvement NFL scouts like to see when evaluating a prospects "upside." In 2013, Henry was a strong contributor, starting six times and making 32 tackles, three for loss. He started six times again the next year, being credited with 20 tackles, 5.5 for loss, three sacks and an interception. Henry began fulfilling his potential during his final year in Ann Arbor, starting nine games and earning honorable mention All-Big Ten honors, racking up 34 tackles, 10 for loss, and tying for the team lead with 6.5 sacks. After talking with former high school and college teammate Frank Clark, who was a second-round pick of Seattle in 2015, Henry decided it was time to leave for the NFL.	Comes off snap with low pad level and is usually the leverage winner. Has strong base and lands heavy-handed strike with initial punch to jar blockers. Powerful enough to stack and 2­-gap. Plays with good football awareness and senses trap blocks coming. Has a good feel for down ­blocks and double teams, and can brace up to limit their effectiveness. Well versed in twist game with effective picks and quickness to come off pick and attack the quarterback. Big closing burst to get home when he smells quarterback. Finished season with 6.5 sacks. Surprising upfield burst when allowed to rush from defensive end.	Can be undisciplined pre-­snap with five encroachment penalties this year. Drops head and eyes off the snap and plays with too much waist­-bending upon initial contact. Needs to unlock his juice off the snap to control neutral zone and make more tackles for losses. Cut blocks chop him down with ease. Plays with turned shoulders and narrow base when flowing with run plays which allow blockers to wash him down. Needs a more varied rush attack.	Star Lotulelei	Henry is an athletic 3­-technique who turns 21 in March and should continue to add functional mass and power to battle and win at the point of attack. Henry?s sack numbers were bolstered by his work in T/E twists and might not be indicative of his ability to beat pass protection consistently, but his understanding of twists and close­out quickness could keep him on the field on third downs. Henry should find his way into a starting lineup sooner rather than later.	\N	33	6.04999999999999982	willie-henry	\N
2555415	Austin	Hooper	5	76	254	10.625	Stanford has become "Tight End U" over the past few years, with former Cardinal contributors Zach Ertz, Levine Tiololo, Coby Fleener and Jim Dray enjoying good NFL careers. Hooper's next in line, leaving for the pros after his redshirt sophomore season. His father actually played at San Diego State, but his uncle, Greg, suited up for Stanford as a fullback from 1979-1982. Those genes were obvious during his two years on the field, first as a redshirt freshman in 2014 where he earned Freshman All-American and second-team All-Pac-12 honors (40-499, two scores). He helped Stanford win a conference championship in his second season, garnering several honors (Mackey Award finalist, third-team AP All-American, first-team All-Pac-12) by catching 34 passes for 438 yards and six touchdowns.	Has capability of playing in­line or as move tight end. Build-up speed allows him to threaten Y-­seam from off line of scrimmage. Hands catcher with excellent hand­-eye coordination and can go get the rock in traffic. Shows enough burst to create separation from linebackers and safeties over the top. Does an adequate job of shielding defenders from the pass and posting them up in space. Strong runner after the catch in screen game and will carry defenders with him into the end zone. Willing blocker who comes from program where run blocking is demanded. Latches onto target with centered blow and shows enough strength to sustain. Looks for work downfield as blocker to help spring explosive runs.	Lacks suddenness and crisp feet in his route work underneath. Could be faced with high number of heavily contested catches in short and intermediate routes. Not much of a salesman with his routes and needs more juice from stem at top of his routes. Would improve separation by meeting physical defenders with increased physicality. Hands need work. Was late getting hands catch­ ready and had nine drops over two seasons for drop rate of almost 11 percent. Catch radius just average for his size. Head ducker as run blocker and can lose track of target and whiff from time to time.	Coby Fleener	Will be labeled as a move tight end, but I see him as being more than that for teams looking for a more complete player. Hooper has a frame that should be able to carry another eight to 10 pounds without much trouble, and he shows enough want­-to as a blocker to see him playing in­line when needed. If Hooper can improve his hands and become craftier with his routes, he could become a solid, 10-­year starter in the league.	\N	51	5.75	austin-hooper	\N
2555417	C.J.	Prosise	2	72	220	8.5	Prosise excelled in several ways for the Irish during his time in South Bend. Due to a lack of talent at the running back position, he was asked to tote the ball regularly in spring 2015 practices, running for 64 yards at the spring scrimmage. The Irish made him their leading rusher this fall, as he gained 1,032 yards and 11 scores on just 156 carries (6.6 average). Prosise also caught 26 passes and 308 yards and one touchdown -- but that was a role in which he had experience the past couple of seasons. He actually led all Irish receivers with 17.8 yards per reception in 2014 (29-516, two TD) and was also the team's Special Teams Player of the Year (11 tackles) and had a 50-yard rush for a touchdown in the Music City Bowl win over LSU. Prosise was actually recruited as a safety, but moved over to receiver for his redshirt freshman season in 2013, starting three times, catching seven passes for 72 yards.	Has every­-down size for the position. Patient, gliding runner with a sense for when it's time to hit the gas and go. Has late cut ability to create new yards for himself. Has effective open-field spin move to elude and the play strength to power through lesser tackle attempts. Efficient runner between the tackles. Runs with desired pad level maintains balance through contact. Falls forward in his finishing. Has enough play speed to turn the corner as outside runner. Experience as receiver gives him upgraded route ability as running back. Has opportunity to be effective on all three levels as receiver if matchup avails itself.	Only one year as full-­time running back. Urgency as runner needs an upgrade. Can be slowed waiting for zone-­read mesh­-point, but indecisiveness flowing outside caused some lost yardage. Fumbled five times in 156 carries losing two. Needs to secure the rock against scavengers looking to rip it away at the end of a run. Recognition of blitzes injuries late.	Fred Jackson	Ascending running back prospect with the physical build to handle a workload, the athleticism to create for himself and the hands to keep stacking total yardage up. While Prosise has the acceleration and play strength to fit into an NFL offense, he needs to become a shade more decisive and has to improve in protections if he is to become a three-­down option. Prosise looks like an immediate "committee" runner with future starter potential.	"He's talented and caught all of us off-­guard to start the season. He looks like he has no idea what he's doing at times in protections and that is what could keep him off the field early in his career." -- NFL West area scout	43	5.54999999999999982	c.j.-prosise	\N
2555418	Jordan	Howard	2	72	230	\N	When Alabama-Birmingham decided to shut down its football program before the 2015 season, the Hoosiers found an outstanding player waiting for a new opportunity in Howard. The Alabama native had two very productive years for the Blazers, who stood by him during the recruiting process after he suffered a torn meniscus and a stress fracture in his pelvis during his junior year in high school. Howard earned five starts as a true freshman in 2013 (881 yards, 6.1 yards per rush average, two touchdowns) and then exploded for first-team All-Conference USA honors the next season. He actually set a UAB rushing record with 1,587 yards on a workhorse-level 306 carries in 2014, scoring 13 times. The step up to a Power Five conference didn't faze Howard, as he won over Big Ten coaches for first-team All-Conference honors (1,213 rush yards, 6.2 yards per rush, nine touchdowns; 11 catches, 106 yards, one touchdown receiving). Rushing for 174 yards against a tough Iowa squad, as well as 238 on 35 carries against Michigan, showed he has the talent to succeed at any level.	Showed ability to step his game up against top competition at both UAB and Indiana. Rushed for at least 145 yards in every full game he played. Natural runner who combines tempo with a special feel for spacial relationships. Pro­-ready vision gives him outstanding feel for run lane developments at the line of scrimmage and onto the second level. Consistently chooses best angles and creases for optimal yardage. For a big back, can make himself skinny through tight quarters. Decisive and punishing. Drops pads and accelerates into contact to batter would-­be tacklers on the second and third levels. Drives legs through arm tackles and goes about his work. Hard-­charging when it?s third- or fourth-and-short. Showed potential in screen game as receiver.	Doesn't have sudden one-­cut ability and has to tap brakes to hit it downhill on outside zone runs. One-speed runner. Can be chased down by backside sprinters before getting to the second level. Takes big hits due to bruising running style. Scouts concerned about ability to stay healthy. Missed four games and parts of three others with knee and ankle injuries. Upright pads and narrow base leads to slips and balance issues when trying to make sharp cuts. Rarely factored into passing game at UAB or Indiana.	Arian Foster	Howard has the optimal size and talent needed to strap the pads on and become a productive workhorse for a team looking for one, true lead back. Howard's vision, power and subtle shiftiness allow him to create and break tackles along the way. Staying healthy in the NFL is a legitimate concern for Howard considering his relentless running style. If he can stay healthy, Howard has the ability to become an instant factor as an NFL starter.	"I just started watching him today and I know why you like him, but he's what I call a 'sack of potatoes' back. He's going to keep getting dropped like a sack of potatoes in this league with that running style." -- NFC running backs coach	31	6.09999999999999964	jordan-howard	\N
2555419	Pharoh	Cooper	4	71	203	9.125	Many college football players are lacking in discipline, driving their coaches crazy. Cooper does not have that problem, as he grew up in a military family -- his grandfather and father were Marines, and his brother is a Marine. After winning back-to-back state high school titles in North Carolina, Cooper used his maturity to get on the field right away for the Gamecocks, receiving Freshman All-SEC honors as an all-purpose back and returner (359 kick return yards). Once given a chance to receive regular touches on offense, Cooper excelled, garnering consensus first team all-conference recognition as a receiver in 2014 (69-1,136, 11 TD) and second team honors as an all-purpose back (200 rushing yards, two scores). His production dipped a bit in 2015 (66-973, nine TD), but South Carolina's offense struggled in many ways this season. SEC coaches still named him first team all-conference receiver and all-purpose player for his efforts.	Short but compact and strong. Especially fast with first three steps off the line. Reaches top speed almost instantly. Should blaze his 10-­yard split at combine. Operates with excellent balance and body control at all times. Staccato footwork and seamless change of direction out of breaks opens early passing window. Will break off route and improvise to free space when route is compromised by coverage underneath it. Competitiveness ramps as soon as he hits the grass. Has burst to steam past safety if cornerback takes bad angle on his slants. Strength to play through contact in his routes. Stutter-go release near goal line is difficult to stop.	Has neither height nor length for desired catch radius. Was unable to reach big­-play throws downfield. Contested catches became a chore. Battled focus and concentration drops at one point. Hip tightness creates rounded routes and limited wiggle after catch. The more wrinkles in the route, the less effective Cooper becomes. Relies on straight line quickness over speed or agility in open field. Limited route exposure while at South Carolina.	Josh Reed	Amidst turbulent offensive times at South Carolina, Cooper has been a rock with consistent production in all areas of the field. While I see Cooper as slightly limited as a pro due to his reliance on straight-line acceleration and scheme fit, NFL personnel men seem to love his playmaking ability and competitive nature.	"He's a good player. Scouts can't worry about how a player like Cooper is going to be used because that is the OC's job. Our job is to find good football players. He's a good football player." -- NFC South scout	85	5.69000000000000039	pharoh-cooper	\N
2555420	Jerald	Hawkins	7	78	305	9.625	Winning a job on LSU's offensive line is no easy task, as head coach Les Miles continually brings in large talents up front. But Hawkins managed to win the starting job at right tackle as a redshirt freshman, even playing on the blind side for an injured La'el Collins in one contest. The Louisiana native started every game at right tackle in 2014, as well, before moving to Collins' left tackle spot this fall. He missed the contest against Ole Miss with an ankle injury, but started the other 12 games in his final season in Death Valley. Despite his pleas to Collins to stay for his senior season last year, Hawkins decided to forego his fourth year on campus to head to the NFL; he's the only Tiger to do so this year.	Long­-limbed tackle with experience on both sides. Slides feet and hips into play-­side positioning after making squared contact on reach blocks and the backside. Flashes power in his paws snatching a portion of defender's frame and maintaining his grip. Plays with good weight distribution and balanced pass sets. Has foot quickness and change of direction for redirect move back inside without much hesitation and brace up his edge. Speedy snap off and search mechanism against twists. Generally well-timed climbs on combo blocks. Uses upward blow with decent hip snap into initial contact in run game. Held his own in snaps against A'Shawn Robinson from Alabama.	Possesses unusually linear build with thin waist for an offensive lineman. Power in base blocks hindered by his narrow drive base. Doesn?t always bring his feet through contact. Overall power and play strength need to improve. Wins early portion of the rep but often gives way to opponents' strength over second half of the snap. Not a natural knee­-bender and misses more than he hits on second level. Doesn't gain enough lateral ground to consistently get to cross­-face blocks and backside cut­off on linebackers. Hands too wide in pass pro set­up leading to slower, wider punch at times. Willing to waist-­bend when pass rusher gets to the edge.	Bobby Massie	Hawkins is a tough evaluation because the length and footwork in pass protection are promising, but issues with bend and body control may be difficult to correct. Hawkins has talent, but his ceiling might be tied directly to whether a team allows him to sit while an offensive line coach works to correct the technical flaws that limit his effectiveness. Hawkins best spot may be right tackle.	"You have to watch him in a few games because he's not asked to do as much in some games as others. In one game you think he looks really strong and then in another game he's kind of all over the place. Some of that is his feet. If he improves his feet he should improve his play strength." -- NFL offensive line coach	91	5.5	jerald-hawkins	\N
2555459	Keith	Marshall	2	71	219	9.375	It was hoped Marshall would be the next great back to play between the hedges. He was the North Carolina Gatorade Player of the Year as a high school senior, rushing for nearly 1,900 yards, and recruiters appreciated that he was the state Class AAAA 100-meter dash champion. Marshall made a great first impression, taking 117 carries as a true freshman for 759 yards and eight scores (he also had 11-91, one TD receiving). Five games into his sophomore season, however, he suffered a torn right ACL against Tennessee and missed the rest of the year (56-246, one TD rushing; 8-111, one TD receiving). He attempted to come back for 2014, but could only play three games (12-24 rushing) because his knee did not heal properly. Ironically, an injury to his teammate, Nick Chubb, made it possible for Marshall to get 68 carries (for 350 yards and three scores) in his final year with the Bulldogs. Instead of petitioning the NCAA for another year of eligibility due to two lost seasons, Marshall decided to move on and try to make his way in the NFL.	Combines size and raw speed. Before knee injuries possessed blazing, third-level speed. Had 12 percent of his runs in 2012 go for 15-plus yards. Has the burst gear and bend to squeeze through constricted run lanes. Tight, efficient footwork for quick lateral cuts before getting run back on track downhill. Makes early tackle attempts miss. Intelligent player who can learn quickly. Limited production in passing game, but able pass catcher.	Doesn't look as fast as before his 2013 ACL tear. Appears to lack confidence as a runner. Hesitant runner through creases like back expecting to be tackled rather than running to daylight. Weight gets too far out over toes causing lack of balance. Misses out on huge runs with inability to shake safety in open field. Missing feel for the rushing track and patience to let blocks develop in outside zone game.	\N	Marshall was a highly recruited running back who flashed massive potential as a freshman but never made his way back up the Georgia ladder due to injuries and incredible depth at the position over the last few years. Marshall could become a lottery ticket for a zone scheme team willing to take a chance that his speed and confidence return with a fresh start in a new location. His ceiling is much higher than many of the Day 3 running backs who could be drafted ahead of him.	\N	83	5.29999999999999982	keith-marshall	\N
2555421	Yannick	Ngakoue	9	74	252	9.5	Born in Washington, D.C., Ngakoue stayed nearby for college after an excellent high school career. He was named the D.C. Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior, racking up 17 sacks and leading Friendship Collegiate to a district title. Nkagoue got his feet wet as a true freshman, making 10 tackles, 4.5 for loss including two sacks, and an interception playing every game as a reserve. His play as a sophomore earned honorable mention notice from league media (37 tackles, 13.5 for loss and six sacks) and portended better things to come. Quarterbacks in the Big Ten did not appreciate his improvement in what proved to be his final collegiate season -- he set a Maryland record and finished tied for second in the country with 13.5 sacks (within 15 total tackles for loss).	Flexible and athletic with a chiseled frame. Produced 45 quarterback pressures and 13 sacks this season. Plays with plus motor. Slippery with ability to find his way into a play even though he's being blocked. Impressive lateral quickness to escape reach blocks and create perimeter contain against the run. Stays low, creeping around the corner before exploding up to the quarterback on twists. Plays with some hip flip around the corner as a pass rusher. Suddenness to unlock a more dangerous inside move.	Needs to improve timing of the snap. False stepper as stand­up rusher and takes five steps to gain five yards when bursting upfield. Pops upright out of his track stance rather than firing up the field. Several sacks the result of extended plays or being unblocked. Engrossed with blocks in front of him and loses track of the ball. Lacks quick shed hand strength or an ability to impact game at the point of attack.	Jackson Jeffcoat	Lacks the desired height and length from an edge player, but does have the athleticism and production teams like. A deep dive into the tape reveals very few "instant wins sacks" and his short strides prevent him from threatening the edge as often as you might expect. While Ngakoue appears to have the traits of an upfield player, he was asked to set edges at Maryland. His production from 2015 will intrigue teams, but he is a work in progress who needs a more developed skill set as a pass rusher if he wants to become a factor in the NFL as a starter.	\N	5	5.38999999999999968	yannick-ngakoue	\N
2555426	Cardale	Jones	1	77	253	9.75	Jones went from relative unknown (outside Ohio) to superstar to backup during his tumultuous Buckeyes career. He signed with Ohio State a semester early after a stellar at career powerhouse Glenville (coached by Ted Ginn, Sr.), redshirted in 2012 and played just 39 plays from scrimmage in 2013 (1-3 passing, 17-128, one TD rushing). But when Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett were lost to injury before and during the 2015 season, respectively, it was Jones? turn to shine. He came in for Barrett to finish off Michigan, beat down Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game, and then led the Buckeyes to a national title a month later. Jones finished the year completing 60.0 percent of his throws for 860 yards and seven touchdowns against two interceptions, as well as rushing for 296 yards and a score. Head Coach Urban Meyer named Jones the starter after a heated battle between he and Barrett, but Jones? inconsistency caused him to lose the job to Barrett halfway through the season (eight starts, 1,460 passing yards, 62.5 percent on completions, eight TD, five INT; 193 yards, two TD rushing). With Barrett returning for another year in 2016, Jones decided to enter the NFL draft as an early entrant rather than finishing his career at another college.	Great size to see over offensive line and bulk to withstand NFL hits. Pocket passer with as much arm as you need. Generates very good velocity without having to get feet set. Can rip it into tight quarters, challenge field-­side cornerbacks and attack safeties over the top. Almost 11 percent of his pass attempts were 20-plus yard completions. Completed 59 percent of intermediate throws and 41 percent of deep throws. Touch and ball placement on long ball is pro caliber. Can drop feathery, touch throws on fade routes. Has size, athleticism and toughness to call his own number in run game and is a chain mover as a scrambler. Interceptions generally due to overthrows and poor timing over bad decision­-making. Though not yet a strength, did show ability to get through progressions and find third option.	Handed starting job and never owned it. Disappointing accuracy issues with difficulty hitting simple slants. Uncorked interceptions where unrushed pocket throws sailed way over the top of targets. Eyeballs receivers and brings heat from instinctive linebackers and defensive backs. Had issues reading and reacting to zone coverage underneath. Doesn't hold safeties with his eyes. Failed to execute timing throws out in rhythm. Will pump and re­set too often forcing out routes against the sideline. Tends to overthrow near goal line and leave touchdown passes on the field. Saw completion numbers drop almost 30 percent when forced to throw on the move. Below average pocket feel and blitz awareness. Was unable to move from checkers to chess against defensive coordinators.	Logan Thomas	Jones is like a complicated meal that may or may not have all the ingredients present and will likely take a long time to prepare. Will the pay­off be worth the investment of time? Jones has very little starting experience and struggled to adjust once defensive coordinators had time to prepare for him this season. The right quarterback coach and passing scheme could promote rapid improvement and high-end production with his ability to strike downfield, but his issues with consistency and accuracy make the "bust" label a very real concern.	"You want to buy into the size and arm but his accuracy and game management just aren?t there yet. He doesn't even have 300 passes under his belt! Compare him to (Teddy) Bridewater and (Derek) Carr. Blows those guys away with the physical stuff but he can't touch their poise and leadership as young quarterbacks." -- NFL offensive coordinator	37	5.44000000000000039	cardale-jones	\N
2555427	Nate	Sudfeld	1	78	234	9.875	Sudfeld missed about half of his junior year with an injured left (non-throwing) shoulder, but this fall he met the expectations of scouts who liked what they saw before the injury. The brother of New York Jets tight end Zach Sudfeld used his intriguing skill set (size, arm and mobility within the pocket) to pull down third-team All-Big Ten honors in 2015. Sudfield completed 60 percent of his passes for 3,573 yards and 27 scores against seven interceptions for a Hoosier squad that was not loaded with weapons. Sudfeld provides leadership and maturity, as well, and has worldly experience (served missions to Uganda before high school and for his 2015 spring break) that many others in this class do not.	Steps onto the field with terrific NFL size. Three-year starter who lead Big Ten in yards per pass play at 8.2 yards. Comfortable operating in timing based systems and shows ability to throw with desired anticipation. Ball usually comes out on time. Able to expedite throws when pressure finds him early. Feels pressure and gets rid of the ball over taking the sack. Makes catchable, accurate throws from the pocket. Shows off NFL arm when he steps and drives to target. Does not fear the field side throws and has arm and accuracy to make them. Puts plenty of air under touch throws allowing receivers a chance to make a play. Showed off consistent touch on deep corners. Competitive as a runner and lays out for first downs over sliding early.	Sets up with a very wide throwing base and slight dip in his delivery. Rarely gets full hip rotation through delivery forcing him to push throws. Touch in close quarters is below average. Field vision is only average. Inconsistent with reads against zone coverage. Makes up his mind and opts for tougher throws over open throws. Struggled in this way against Iowa. At times, rushes throws over sliding in pocket waiting for routes to develop. Saw substantial dip in completion percentage when rushed by five-plus defenders. Underthrows were culprit with deep ball accuracy. Not much of a threat with his legs.	Sean Mannion	Veteran quarterback with the desired frame for the position and coming off of his best year yet. Sudfeld tends to push the ball rather than deliver with a clean weight­ shift and follow through, creating inconsistencies with accuracy and velocity. There is some solid tape on Sudfeld that could give NFL teams hope, but issues with making the right reads will work against him.	"I love his size and he made that senior jump that we like to see.

2555428	Vernon	Adams	1	71	200	9.125	Though short for the position, Adams won numerous FCS honors in three years at EWU, completing 65 percent of his passes for more than 10,000 yards and a whopping 110 touchdowns. He then transferred to Oregon as a college graduate to take over for 2014 Heisman Trophy winner and No. 2 overall draft pick, Marcus Mariota. His final collegiate season did not go as planned, however, as he broke his right thumb playing against his former team in the opener, limiting him for a few games. Adams looked great once healthy (64.9 completion percentage, 2,643 yards, 26 touchdowns, six interceptions for 2015), leading the team to six straight wins. The honorable mention All-Pac-12 pick got hurt again in the Alamo Bowl, where his team blew the 28-0 lead Adams had built to lose, 47-41. Even though injuries kept him off the field most of his senior year, he proved not to shrink against the higher level of competition.	Produced at a high level during his single season in the Ducks offense. Recognizes danger and typically avoids it. Only one of six interceptions due to decision-­making. Shows ability to get through progressions. No hesitation to bounce to next read if he spies too much congestion with primary reads. Throws with adequate touch to all levels. Has foot quickness to depart compressed pockets from variety of angles to extend play and complete passes. Packaged play potential.	Short, light and small hands. High-end yards per attempt slightly misleading due to scheme. Below average anticipation outside of single read route combinations. Field vision marginal. Fails to see early, easy throws. Extended release time waiting for throwing windows to open wide. Forces offensive line into extended pass protection and high sack total (26). Hesitant to challenge secondary between the hashes. Antsy feet in pocket and prefers to leave and look over sitting tight. Has long windup with slightly below 3/4 delivery. Ball placement needs improvement.	B.J. Daniels	Extremely undersized for the position, Adams had success at Oregon despite just one season within its scheme. He doesn't have optimal anticipation or field vision and missed big play opportunities as they were opening. Adams can hit deep balls on scramble throws and won't take unnecessary chances, but teams might pass on him due to "system and size" concerns. I wouldn't close the door on his chances to make a team due to athleticism and play-making potential in packaged plays.	"I wouldn't draft him but I watched him at Eastern Washington and Oregon, and he's got something to him as a competitor. I would have no problem bringing him into camp and seeing what happens." -- NFC West area scout	48	4.95000000000000018	vernon-adams	\N
2555429	Joel	Stave	1	77	236	10.75	Stave was an all-state pick from the Badger State who stayed close to home and reaped the benefits, eventually becoming the winningest quarterback in Wisconsin history with a 31-10 record as a starter. He started six games as a redshirt freshman at UW, completing 58.8 percent of his passes for 1,104 yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions. He would have started more games but a broken collarbone suffered in October cost him the rest of the regular season. Stave hit a peak to his career as a sophomore, accepting honorable mention All-Big Ten notice as a 13-game starter (61.9 percent, 2,494 yards, 22 touchdownss, 13 interceptions). His shoulder was injured in the team's Capital Bowl loss to South Carolina, however, which affected him into the next season. Eventually he regained the starting job as a junior, but couldn't connect often enough with his receivers (53.4 percent, 1,350 yards, nine touchdowns, 10 interceptions). Stave bounced back a bit as a senior, completing over 60 percent of his throws for a career-high 2,687 yards and 11 touchdowns, though that total matched the 11 interceptions he threw during the year. He gave NFL scouts something to think about with his effort in the Holiday Bowl win over USC, completing 18 of 27 passes for 217 yards and a touchdown on a big stage.	Looks the part with good size and a pretty, over-­the-­top delivery. Plays in pro-­style offense and is experienced under center. Steps and drives the intermediate throws and ball comes out of his hand with a tight spiral and heat on it. Possesses above average arm strength and was asked to make NFL throws in his offense. Rhythm passer able to throw with timing. Comfortable and efficient on roll outs and bootlegs.	Accuracy and ball placement are hit or miss. Throws at or slightly behind moving targets rather than throwing them open.. Below average pocket mobility. Shows signs of pocket panic dropping eyes at early signs of pressure. Can't win with his legs. Plays with blinders and will make throws with no awareness of safeties lurking. Poor decision making and accuracy on third downs attempting to fit throws into impossible spots.	Tom Savage	Stave has size, a strong arm, loads of experience and plays in a run­-first offense, yet he's produced 19 touchdowns and 22 interceptions over the last two seasons. For all the physical boxes he checks off, issues with accuracy and decision-­making have been too present in his game and fans at Wisconsin let him know about it. Stave throws as pretty a pass as any quarterback in this draft, but very few quarterbacks have been able to overcome his weaknesses and become reliable NFL quarterbacks.	"He's got the physical tools that are going to get him drafted and give him a shot with a team. Coaches who are just seeing him are going to be more excited about him than the scouts who know him." -- NFC executive	40	5.08000000000000007	joel-stave	\N
2555430	Alex	Collins	2	70	217	9.25	It didn't take long for Collins, one of the most highly recruited high school running backs in the country, to make his mark for the Razorbacks. In fact, he was the first true freshman to start his career with three 100-yard performances since Adrian Peterson in 2004. Even though he shared carries with Jonathan Williams in his first two years on campus, Collins rolled up more than 1,000 yards each year (1,026 with 4 TD in 2013, 1,100 with 12 TD in 2014), joining Darren McFadden as the only Arkansas backs to accomplish that feat. With Williams out with an injury in 2015, Collins's carries increased from 204 in 2014 to 271 in 2015 as did his production (1,577 yards, 20 TD). He earned second team All-SEC honors in his final year, finishing behind Heisman Trophy winner Derrick Henry (Alabama) and Leonard Fournette (LSU). One of the toughest runners in college football, Collins made the jump to the NFL after his junior year.	Well-built, durable frame with feet from a wind­up toy. Plays with amazingly consistent and repetitive tempo as a runner. Able to weave in, out and around traffic without breaking his speed or tempo. Has foot quickness and agility to avoid the backfield traffic and the instant acceleration to get the run back underway. Patient and probing while waiting for a crease. Pad level and knee bend are outstanding. Keeps shoulders square to the line and stays low and tight through the hole. Excellent vision on the interior and consistently jukes and side­steps tackle attempts to create additional yardage. Touchdown hog. Plated 32 rushing touchdowns over last three years. Runs with consistent forward lean and always falls forward.	One speed runner. Doesn't play with natural one-­cut stride length and everything comes off stutter-stepping, choppy strides. Feel for outside runs is off. Breaks runs back inside prematurely that still have life along their original track. Can't generate enough momentum through contact acceleration to be a tackle breaker. Credited with just five broken tackles over his last 475 carries. Unproven as pass catcher and inconsistent in squaring up his pass protection responsibilities. Has 17 career fumbles with nine lost.	Chris Ivory	Collins is the epitome of consistency rushing for over 1,000 yards and at least 5.4 yards per carry in each of his three seasons. Vision and footwork are the catalysts for his elusiveness and he has flashed long speed. Collins is a repetitive runner lacking dynamic talent, but he's run in gap, power and zone schemes and should be a scheme fit for most teams looking at running back. Collins should be able to step right in and challenge for carries and red zone work immediately.	"Last year I thought Jonathan Williams was the better back, but Collins changed my mind this year. He's not special but he's solid. I think he's probably a third-rounder." -- SEC area scout	89	5.69000000000000039	alex-collins	\N
2555431	Quayvon	Hicks	3	73	259	9.625	In a time where true fullbacks are not used regularly at the college or pro level, Hicks found a good home at Georgia, where he led the way for multiple 1,000-yard rushers. He played primarily on special teams for 12 games in his true freshman season before becoming a part of the offense the following season. Hicks started six games, playing 13, and getting his hands on the ball as a runner (10-72, one TD) and receiver (5-67) as a sophomore. He again started six of 13 games played in 2014, rushing nine times for 85 yards and two scores while catching four passes for 31 yards. His production dropped as a senior (4-9 rushing; 3-34 receiving), but his contributions as a blocker were acknowledged with an invite to the NFL Scouting Combine.	Burly, well-­proportioned frame. Has booming power if he lands squarely as a downhill thumper. Plays with good speed to get out in front as lead blocker. Has experience with short yardage carries and can catch the ball out of the backfield. Former high school defensive tackle with plenty of physicality to his game. Able blocker in pass protection.	Extremely inconsistent with reads on outside zone plays. Showed hesitation and assignment confusion on some snaps. Bulky in space with very average body control and ability to radar in on moving shifty targets. Missed bowl game with a knee injury.	Jalston Fowler	Imposing fullback with enough power to kick­ out defenders and strike linebackers with authority. Hicks' biggest issues appear to be processing his assignment quickly and consistently. With his size and ability to catch the ball out of the backfield, he could get a call on Day 3 of the draft.	"Old-school fullback with size and power. He had a play against South Carolina where he catches it and hurdles over a tackler like he's a five-­star running back. That caught my eye." -- AFC southeastern area scout	83	5.07000000000000028	quayvon-hicks	\N
2555432	Andy	Janovich	3	73	238	9.75	The walk-on tradition at Nebraska is strong, with many players becoming stars after failing to receive a scholarship before arriving on campus. Janovich was an All-Nebraska pick at running back and linebacker, while also winning two state wrestling titles (one at 220 pounds and one at 189 pounds). The Cornhusker staff decided to combine his experience as a ballcarrier with his love of physical play, moving him to fullback. He played in 11 games, starting two, as a true freshman (3-4 rushing, 2-13 receiving) before contributing in 13 games in 2013. Janovich battled through rehabbing a knee injury at the start of his junior season, playing in all 13 games to aid Ameer Abdullah's quest for 1,000 yards and starting the final two. He had his most prolific season as a senior, running the ball 42 times for 265 yards and three scores and catching two passes for 58 yards. Despite the drop in NFL teams looking for true fullbacks, Janovich earned an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine, possibly due to his special teams process (13 tackles in 2015).	Rare running fullback with short-area wiggle to make defenders miss. Grinds through contact and can break tackles en route to grinding out additional yardage. Might have value as short yardage runner in pros. Runs feet through downhill contact on iso blocks. Can help as blocker in pass pro. Special teams cover specialist with 13 tackles this season. Can play elephant in pros and cover kickoffs. Weight room warrior.	Could be limited by scheme fit. Doesn't have girth teams look for in hammer-­head lead blocker. More of a positional blocker than kick-­out blocker against edge setters. Has habit of ducking head into blocks. Limited experience in passing attack.	Mike Burton	Undersized H-back with the ability to give teams a carry here and there and do enough as a blocker to warrant consideration on the roster. Janovich was an extremely productive special teamer this season and if he can prove himself to be an adequate pass­ catcher, he could find his way onto a roster and get some snaps. Fullbacks and H-backs have limited draft value, but Janovich has a good shot at making a roster once he gets into camp.	"He's a dude! Loves to bang weights and hunt. My kind of guy. They didn't ask him to catch the ball much, but I think he can do it." -- Big Ten scout	16	5.16000000000000014	andy-janovich	\N
2555458	Tre	Madden	2	72	223	9.375	With an uncle (former USC/NFL corner Daylon McCutcheon) who coaches for the New York Jets, a grandfather that scouts for the Los Angeles Rams (former star running back Lawrence McCutcheon), and a father (Curtis) that played running back at Kansas State, it's easy to see how football became a big part of Madden's life. Unfortunately, he hasn?t been able to take full advantage of his talents during his time at USC, missing the 2012 (knee) and 2014 (turf toe) seasons due to injuries and being slowed in two other seasons. He played 12 games (with one start) as a linebacker for the Trojans before coaches moved him to running back after the season. Madden tore knee ligaments during spring 2012 practices, however, postponing his debut in the backfield until 2013. He ran for 100 yards in three straight games to start that season, starting the Trojans? first six contests, but a hamstring injury caused him to take it easy over the rest of the year (he finished with 138-703, three TD rushing; 15-201, four TD receiving). It was a similar story for Madden in 2015 (85-452, five TD rushing; 17-133, one TD receiving), as he started six games to start the year, hitting the 100-yard mark twice before another knee injury limited his carries until he had surgery after the regular season.	Compact frame with good overall size and leg thickness. Former linebacker who runs with toughness and a hint of nasty. Used in short yardage spots and came through. Lowers head and leans into contact absorbing the hit and falling forward for the tough yards. Runs a reliable track trusting his blockers and making cuts off of their blocks. Willing pass blocker on third downs. Intelligent player with football character. Football runs in the family.	Average athlete with hip tightness and knee issues that limit his ability to make sharp, lateral cuts to avoid defenders. Mundane burst through the hole allowing defensive linemen to get into him. Doesn't have edge speed to consistently get the corner. Can't stay healthy. Missed 2012 with a knee injury and 2014 with turf toe. Missed time in December of 2015.	\N	While Madden has the size and toughness to intrigue teams, his checkered history with injuries and lack of functional athleticism are a concern. Madden is more of a "get what's blocked" type of back than a creator and might have to be a short yardage worker for now. If his medicals don't check out, it won't matter.	\N	50	5	tre-madden	\N
2555460	Paul	Perkins	2	70	208	\N	Seeing Perkins succeed as a college running back is not surprising, given that his father Bruce (whose first name is actually Paul) played fullback for two years in the NFL and his uncle Don played eight years for the Dallas Cowboys. His younger brother, Bryce, redshirted at Arizona State (where Bruce played) last year, as well. Living up to the family name can be challenging, but Perkins showed great promise as a redshirt freshman by starting six games and finishing as the team's top rusher after athletic quarterback Brett Hundley (134-573, six touchdowns). Hundley didn?t have to run as much in 2014, handing the ball to Perkins 251 times and watching the back go for a Pac-12 best 1,575 yards and nine touchdowns (plus 26 passes to Perkins for 201 yards and two scores). He somehow was only voted honorable mention all-conference for that performance, but coaches wised up in 2015, naming him to their second-team after another excellent season (1,343 yards, 14 TD rushing; 30-242, one TD receiving).	One of the top creators in the draft combining elite vision and a wicked jump­-cut. Can disappear before tackler's eyes and put them on his highlight reel. Shows no directional tendencies with his cuts and can make defenders miss in tight quarters. Decisive when working between the tackles, but can bounce it when warranted. Flashes sudden, 1­-cut ability on stretch plays. Stacks moves on moves. Reliable hands when asked to help in passing game. Willing to stick his nose in against the blitz.	Smallish frame for the big-­boy workload asked of him. Arm tackle attempts cause hiccup in his journey. Runs halted abruptly when tacklers square him up. Could be forced off field in short yardage spots. Missing NFL-­caliber force to run through contact and fall forward. Limited to swings, screens and wheels as receiver. Lacked consistent play speed with his wheel routes. Might lack requisite sand in his pants to be counted on for NFL blitz pickup.	Duke Johnson	If Perkins had more size and play strength to go with his elusiveness, we would be talking about whether he or Ezekiel Elliott would be the first running back off the board. While Perkins' tape is full of ankle-breaking cuts, his draft value will also be determined by his ability to protect the quarterback and stay on the field in short-yardage spots. If Perkins finds the right scheme and team fits for his talents, he could become a high-­end committee back early on.	"Poor man's Jamaal Charles. The tape tells you everything on him. He's not big, he's not fast, he has great feet and he competes. The combine workout won't tell you anything new. I'm interested to meet the kid and see what he's like." -- NFC general manager	52	5.75999999999999979	paul-perkins	\N
2555461	Wendell	Smallwood	2	70	208	9.25	The Big 12's leading rusher in 2015 was Smallwood, in a bit of an upset over bigger names like Oklahoma's Samaje Perine and Baylor's Shock Linwood. He rushed for 1,519 yards and nine touchdowns in 13 games, while also catching 26 passes out of the backfield for 160 yards, in what proved to be his final year with the Mountaineers after filing for early entry into the 2016 NFL Draft. As a sophomore, Smallwood was second on the team with 722 rushing yards and two scores on 148 carries, and contributed 31 catches for 326 yards as a receiver. He had showed promise as a true freshman, as well, (39-221 rushing; 11-132 receiving, one start in 12 games), but he nearly was untracked in the following offseason after being arrested on a warrant for a witness tampering charge. Smallwood was accused of telling someone to recant their statement accusing one of his friends in a fatal shooting case. The charges were officially dropped when his friend pleaded guilty in the murder case, allowing Smallwood to continue his football career.	Hits the crease with proper pad level and can spin off of initial tackle attempt on his way to additional yardage. Attacks his foes with lead shoulder at the end of the run for an aggressive finish. Runs a disciplined track as zone runner using solid vision and steady tempo. One of the sharpest players on the offense. Scans and spots blitzers on the creep and steps over to meet them as a blocker. Possesses exceptional hands as an option out of the backfield.	Can use more beef on his frame to handle the rigors of the NFL. Monotone runner who tends to keep his runs at one speed. Not flashy or particularly creative as a runner. Gets what is blocked and is more of a physical finisher than tackle breaker. Has an extended gear down on outside zone to hit downhill cuts. Average athleticism and lacks the sudden jump cut.	\N	Smallwood changed West Virginia from an "Air Raid" offense to a "ground and pound" attack. Smallwood's tape features few, true flash plays, but the quality runs seem to stack up one after another. His intelligence in pass pro and ability to catch the ball out of the backfield give him an immediate shot as a third-down back, but his combine could determine whether he hears his name on Day 3 of the draft or not.	\N	29	5.12000000000000011	wendell-smallwood	\N
2555462	Kelvin	Taylor	2	70	207	8.25	Talk about football genes ... this Gator followed in the steps of his father Fred Taylor, one of the most productive running backs in Florida and NFL history. It was not surprising that he become the Florida high school record-holder in rushing yards, accumulating 12,121 yards and 191 touchdowns in five years on the varsity squad (yes, he played as an eighth grader). The 2012 Lou Groza High School Player of the Year joined his father in winning the award, becoming the first family duo to do so. Taylor showed glimpses of that talent in a Freshman All-SEC season in 2013 (508 rush yards, four TD) and a sophomore season without a ton of opportunities (565 yards, six TD on 116 carries). He finally became "the man" for the Gators, getting 259 totes and covering 1,035 yards and scoring 13 times while also catching 17 passes for 150 yards. He might not be drafted in the first round, like his father was in 1998 by Jacksonville (ninth overall pick), but Taylor has an NFL future.	Plays the game with advanced understanding of an NFL player's son. Able to find additional yardage on his own with vision and outstanding lateral agility. Sweeping jump ­cut eludes sudden road­blocks. Can squeeze through a narrow patch when needed. Stacks cuts on cuts onto the second level. Has quickness to gain the corner. Never fumbled during time at Florida spanning 486 carries and 510 touches. Understands job requirements as pass blocker and executes to best of his ability.	Shows lack of patience at time failing to press line of scrimmage and open up cutback lanes. Indecisive, at times, when approaching the line and seems to always be looking for the next cut rather than finishing the run. Doesn't have tackle-­breaking power and runs often end at contact. Despite willingness to block, lacks the beef to hold ground against A-­gap linebackers.	Bobby Rainey	Quicker-­than­-fast running back with the vision and footwork to be a creator, but a potential lack of power and commitment between the tackles to be an every down back. Taylor's work ethic and toughness should make fans of running back coaches, but his ceiling may be as a change of pace runner in a committee.	\N	82	5.28000000000000025	kelvin-taylor	\N
2555463	Shad	Thornton	2	72	217	9.75	Although Thornton's talent as a runner could have earned him top-100 consideration, his inability to stay out of trouble might prevent him from being drafted at all. He was suspended for the first two games of 2015 for a rules violation, and then dismissed from the team after two incidents involving his scooter. Thornton was charged with assaulting a female (his girlfriend) in the summer of 2013, missing one game that season. He also was found in possession of marijuana in December 2013 and March 2014, though the charges were dismissed in both cases. Thornton actually led the Wolfpack in rushing three straight seasons, putting up 694 yards (three touchdowns) in 2012 and 768 yards (four touchdowns) in 2013 before earning honorable mention All-ACC accolades in 2014 (907 yards, nine touchdowns) in a platoon backfield. He played well the first three games of his senior season (203 yards, 6.8 per carry, three touchdowns) before running afoul of the law.	Fluid hips with ability to get to top speed quickly. Decisive runner with the burst to get through the crease and on top of linebackers quickly. At home on sweep plays where he uses speed to turn the corner or vision for cutback lanes. Better tackle breaker than gangly frame warrants.	Unreliable hands as pass catcher. Wild, upright running style opens him to heavy hits. Plays with rushed approach creating some balance issues. Severe character red flags. Dismissed from the team early in season after an arrest involving a moped crash. Has had numerous brushes with authority. Suspended for one game in 2013 after a physical altercation with his girlfriend in the student library.	\N	Lanky frame could be filled out with more time and weight room work and his burst and urgency could be appealing to teams. However, Thornton has had so many legal and character issues during his time at North Carolina State that his path to the pros will likely involve a camp invite only.	\N	6	4.59999999999999964	shad-thornton	\N
2555464	DeAndre	Washington	2	68	204	\N	Smart coaches take advantage of the talent that is on their roster. Former Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury showed his intelligence by figuring out that he needed to get the rock to his wrecking ball named DeAndre Washington, despite the team's reputation as a pass-first squad. Certainly, Washington contributed throughout his career, starting off playing in 11 games (one start) as a true freshman (77-366, three touchdowns). But that year ended with a torn ACL, so he was forced to redshirt the 2012 season. Washington got back on track as a sophomore (107-485, four touchdowns in 12 games, two starts) and became "the man" for Tech as a junior, garnering second-team All-Big 12 honors by covering 1,103 yards on just 188 carries (5.9 per rush) and scoring twice. Given the chance to carry the ball nearly 20 times a game as a senior, Washington proved his worth with a first-team All-Big 12 pick (233-1,492, 14 touchdowns). NFL teams won?t ignore his contributions in the passing game, either (30-328, two touchdowns in 2014; 41-385, two touchdowns in 2015).	Exceptional turnover in his feet. Gets up to top gear quickly and plays there. Gamer who lacks no confidence. Short but muscular with well-­built calves and a toughness that belies his size. Is unafraid of the work required as an interior runner. Works to keep his pads square and runs with desired balance. Can push through an arm tackle and is willing in pass protection. Dangerous run after catch ability in screen game and from the slot. Reliable and productive.	Overall size will be a challenging obstacle to conquer. Predictably small hands may have lead to issues with drops and fumbles. Showed inconsistency and lack of discipline with his run path at times. More straight­-line quick and shifty in space. Vision is nothing special and is often late making necessary reads and cuts. Too small to pick up blitzing linebackers in NFL.	Branden Oliver	Productive running back who was able to have an impact on the ground and through the air in Texas Tech's wide-­open attack. Washington is short but compact and certainly does not lack the toughness to transition into the NFL, but issues with drops and ball security could hurt his chances to make a roster if he can't prove to be a kick return option at some point during camp.	"Really competes hard. Glad he got the call at the Senior Bowl and I thought he handled himself well. Size is big concern. He returned kicks early in his career and may have to prove he can do that to add enough roster value to stick." -- AFC South personnel executive	21	4.95000000000000018	deandre-washington	\N
2555465	DeMarcus	Ayers	4	69	182	9.25	Ayers was an explosive, if undersized, running back from Texas when he arrived on the UH campus, but left after three years as one the best combination slot receiver/return specialists in the country. Getting the ball in his hands was important to Houston coaches, so he lined up as the primary kick returner as a true freshman, earning first-team All-AAC honors (37-1,021, one TD) while working his way into a starting spot the final three games of the year (11-130, one TD receiving). Ayers continued to return kicks in his sophomore year (34-592) but also started eight games as a receiver (33-335, two TD). With the exciting Greg Ward, Jr. operating as the team's quarterback (and leading rusher) in 2015, Ayers fed off that energy to earn first-team all-conference with 98 catches for 1,222 yards and six scores while going back to his roots as a running back at times (25-147, one TD rushing). He also moved from returning kickoffs to taking back punts, earning first team accolades there as well (28-290, one TD). In the Cougars' Peach Bowl win over Florida State, Ayers threw for a touchdown, too. That meant he had done just about everything he could as a collegiate offensive weapon, so he decided to head to the NFL instead of returning with Ward for another run in 2016.	Creates doubt in cornerbacks at the stem with exaggerated head and shoulder fake and aggressive jab step. Has working understanding of leverage in routes and works to create desired movement from defender. Gets off the line and into routes with forward lean and desired acceleration. Can slip initial tackler and add to his yards after catch. Talented punt returner with good ability to weave through traffic and find the open doors. Frame has more room for muscle.	Smaller than ideal. Limited to slot work in the pros. Benefited from scheme that fed him bubble screens, speed outs and jet sweeps. Inexperienced route runner lacking work in more complex passing attack. Catch and run specialist with just 53.1 percent of his receptions going for first downs. Not as sudden as expected. Has shown struggles with double catches and focus drops. Slight hesitation into his routes off snap. Will have to learn to play against more physical corners looking to jam and body him.	Quan Bray	Ayers has some raw talent that is still in the incubation stages, but he surprised some NFL scouts with his decision to come out early. Ayers isn't the lateral "wiggle" player you expect to see when you first turn the tape on, but he can make the first tackler miss. At best, Ayers is a back end of the roster type receiver right now, but his punt return ability and a big combine could push his draft stock up a bit.	"Should have gone back to school and worked on his craft. Right now I don't think he can distinguish himself enough from others at that same position. I need to see those system guys transcend the scheme and I didn't see it." -- NFL personnel director	58	5.16999999999999993	demarcus-ayers	\N
2555466	Tyler	Boyd	4	73	197	9.75	Despite experiencing uneven quarterback play during his time at Pitt, Boyd became the most prolific pass-receiver in the school?s history, setting records for receptions (254 in three years) and receiving yards (3,361). Boyd grew up not far from Pittsburgh, and stood out even in a football-crazy state like Pennsylvania, setting the state record with 117 career touchdowns and winning the Class A Player of the Year twice. As a freshman, Boyd didn?t disappoint, garnering third-team All-ACC honors with 85 catches covering 1,174 yards and seven scores. He also ran for 108 yards and earned 425 kick return yards for the season, as well as returning a punt 54 yards for a score in the team?s bowl game. Boyd received first team all-conference nods as a receiver in his sophomore (78-1,261, eight TD receiving) and junior (91-926, six TD receiving, 349 rush yards), while collecting second-team All-ACC honors as a returner in 2014 (442 kick return yards, 162 punt return yards). With all of that production in just three seasons, it was no surprise Boyd entered the 2016 NFL Draft.	Ultra-competitive. Known for powerful hands that clamp instantly onto ball and finish heavily contested catches. Has over-­the­-middle toughness. Plays with outstanding body control and has ability to gyrate and contort in mid­air in order to make acrobatic catches look easy. Brimming with confidence. Targeted 124 times or more in each of his three seasons. Able to create window through route polish. Sinks into breaks and comes out low with good turn radius when needed. Sits in space and slows routes when necessary to prevent safety from crowding him in deep middle. Has handled some kick return and punt return duties during his time at Pitt.	Relatively low touchdown production to target rate. Marginal long speed. Isn't a threat to run by corners and has to win with routes and hands. Just a possession receiver much of the year. Limited YAC potential due to lack of shake in open field and power to break tackles. Became a fumble factory on punt returns this year and ball security must be addressed. Lacks juice to be full-­time kick returner. Separation windows close quickly due to average get­away quickness out of breaks. Needs to use body better to protect the catch rather than just relying on strong mitts.	Keenan Allen	Pittsburgh asked Boyd to be a running back and possession receiver this season, but that doesn't define what he can be in the pros. Boyd makes up for a lack of speed with vice ­grips for hands and being intelligent in his routes. Boyd isn't a stand­alone WR1, but he can be a very productive starter in a play-­action attack that allows him to play to his strengths.	"I think he can overcome some of his speed deficiencies with good routes and he has hand strength like (Jarvis) Landry in Miami. I would take him in the second or third." -- AFC East scout	24	5.90000000000000036	tyler-boyd	\N
2555467	D.J.	Foster	4	70	193	9.25	Even though Foster's blend of acceleration and toughness as a runner made him one of the best running backs in the country (second-team All-Pac-12), he decided his future interests were best served using his excellent receiving skills in the slot for his senior season. The all-purpose threat was the only Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) player with 1,500 career rushing and receiving yards coming into his senior year, and was used in both roles again in 2015 (280 rushing yards; 59-584 receiving, three scores). Although he didn't make a ton of big plays in his new role, NFL teams might still consider him a valued prospect.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	45	5.13999999999999968	d.j.-foster	\N
2555468	Rashard	Higgins	4	73	196	9.75	A bit overshadowed playing in Fort Collins, Higgins was simply one of the most productive players in college football the past two seasons. The school's all-time leader in receptions (239), receiving yards (3,649) and receiving touchdowns (31). He actually had his worst season in 2015 with a new offense and a new quarterback (75-1,062, 8 TD) but was still a first team All-Mountain West selection. His 2014 season was phenomenal, garnering consensus All-American and first team all-conference honors with 96 catches (10th in the FBS) for a nation-leading 1,750 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Biletnikoff Award finalist's 17 touchdowns averaged 35 yards each. The honorable mention all-Texas pick became an immediate starter for the Rams in 2013, leading the team with 68 catches for 837 yards and six touchdowns.	Has sink into his breaks and comes out with enough juice for workable separation. Possesses decent run after the catch talent. All-­day hands catcher with good extension who saw substantial improvement with his battle against focus drops. Focuses like a laser when tracking the deep ball. Understands how to work late separation along sideline through leverage. Always on top of his high-­point game as a downfield pass catcher. Subtle in his routes but able to get corners leaning.	Pedestrian speed into routes. Will need to improve the sharpness of his routes to gain adequate separation in the pros. Had moments of nonchalance near end zone. Saw explosive catch rate drop from 25 percent to 13 percent. Play strengths is a shade below where it needs to be. Can get stuck to press coverage and will need to vary and improve his release. Gets in the way as a blocker, but might lack commitment.	Devin Street	Slightly built short strider with effervescent personality and an endless supply of confidence, Higgins has been highly targeted and extremely productive in each of his three seasons with the Rams. Higgins showed off improved hands to go with his winning ball skills when the ball is in the air. His lack of strength and average release quickness is a concern against NFL press coverage, but the overall package is good enough to find snaps as a pro.	"I can tell you that 'Hollywood' is not lacking in confidence. Good player but he might be buying into those stats from last year a little too hard. He'll see how much faster the game is going to get. His position coach (Alvis Whitted) played in the pros and I think he's really helped." -- NFC North scout	76	5.48000000000000043	rashard-higgins	\N
2555469	Johnny	Holton	4	73	190	9.875	The Bearcats' passing offense ranked sixth in the country in 2015, possessing enough depth at receiver that Holton only managed 17 receptions in eight games (missing time with hamstring and other injuries). But the 27.1 yards-per-catch average (461 total) and five scores caught the eye of talent evaluators. Holton has been a big-play receiver wherever he's been. First, he succeeded at the junior college level by racking up 548 yards and eight touchdowns on just 23 catches (23.8 average) for the College of Dupage (Ill.) as a sophomore and 17-289, seven TD as a freshman. Once he appeared on the UC campus, not only did he became a reliable downfield receiver (29-431, five TD in 2014), but also kick returner (45-942 in 2014-2015).	Outstanding long speed to outside the numbers to force safeties into early, over­-the-­top help. Has true separation speed for the big play. Almost half of his 17 catches went for 25-plus yards. In his final three games, had seven catches for 269 yards and three touchdowns. Brings kick return experience with him.	Straight-line speedster lacking the fluid hips for intricate routes and sudden change of direction. Scouts believe he is finesse player who can only play outside the numbers. Extremely limited in routes he was asked to run. Missed six games due to two leg injuries. Soft blocker offering little value in that department.	\N	Straight-­up vertical guy who can blaze and hit the home run, but who lacks of completeness to his game. Holton's size and speed are worthy of attention and his ability to return kicks gives him a better chance to make a roster than most limited speedsters.	\N	56	4.84999999999999964	johnny-holton	\N
2555471	Kenny	Lawler	4	74	203	10.5	Lawler and quarterback Jared Goff made a great combination for Cal, helping the Bears increase their win total from one to eight over the past three seasons. As a redshirt freshman, tied for the team lead with five touchdown catches among his 37 receptions for 347 yards. Goff and Lawler left for the NFL after a strong 2015 season for both, with Lawler voted a first-team All-Pac-12 pick with 52 catches, 658 yards, and 13 touchdowns (ranking in the top ten nationally). He finished his Cal career with three touchdowns against Air Force in the Armed Forces Bowl.	Touchdown maker at Cal scoring once every 5.3 receptions. Uses tight, sharp footwork getting in and out of his breaks. Has a feel for finding opening against zone. Runs routes with consistent play speed. Able to get to top speed early. Sinks into comeback routes and works aggressively back to the throw. Snatches the ball away from his body with impressive hand strength. Hands and body control to make the "wow" catch up top or down low.	String­-bean body type. Play strength will always be a concern depending upon individual matchup. Will need to tighten up release against NFL press corners. Inconsistent route runner. Scouts question how he will run at combine. Tape doesn't show cushion-­eating speed to inspire fear in NFL corners. Average ability to create after the catch. Concentration drops have crept into his play at times.	\N	Tall, but thin possession receiver who produced impressive touchdown totals in Cal's "Bear Raid" offense. While Lawler's footwork gets him in and out of his breaks quickly, he will find that NFL cornerbacks will try and suffocate him underneath without fear of deep ball retribution. Lawler's short-area quickness and ability to snare the difficult catch could be an intriguing pairing from the slot where he could find the size matchups more to his liking.	\N	47	5.45999999999999996	kenny-lawler	\N
2555472	Roger	Lewis	4	72	201	9.75	In February of 2012, Lewis was meant to be announcing which school he would be attending. Instead, he was in jail facing two charges of felony rape. Eventually he was found not guilty of one count and accepted three years' probation after pleading down to falsification in exchange for dismissal of the rape charge. Once the legal troubles were behind him, and after playing the 2013 season at Jireh Prep School (35-900, 13 touchdowns), Lewis signed with Bowling Green. His impact was swift, earning first-team All-MAC honors after catching 73 passes for 1,093 and seven scores. Lewis dominated the MAC again as a sophomore, grabbing 85 balls for 1,544 yards (which ranked second in the FBS) and 16 touchdowns. Lewis made the most of his second chance, and after leaving school early, is in prime condition to achieve his dream of playing in the NFL.	Found his way into several, big play catches down the field for Bowling Green. Has size and arm length for desired catch radius to pluck floaters over the top. Able to avoid head­-on collisions in the middle of the field and adjust routes while making the catch. Saw production dramatically spike across the board despite 11 fewer targets than in 2014. Half of his 16 touchdown catches were for 45 yards or more.	After a red-­hot start, cooled way down over the second half of the season. Looked completely overmatched against Tennessee's cornerbacks. Doesn't have vertical push to back cornerbacks off and allow him room for comebacks. Missing twitch or suddenness to uncover in tight quarters. Needs to add strength. Ball skills need work. Gets late start leaping and attacking the downfield throw at high­ point.	\N	While Lewis produced some eye-­popping deep ball numbers, he's not a true vertical receiver in terms of speed and ball skills. His build­up speed can get him past cornerbacks looking to squat on Bowling Green's underneath work, but he could find vertical success in the NFL to be exceptionally challenging due to his lack of speed and overall traits.	\N	102	4.83000000000000007	roger-lewis	\N
2555473	Ricardo	Louis	4	74	215	9.5	Louis is part of Auburn football lore because of his miracle catch on a tipped pass to beat rival Georgia with less than a minute remaining in 2013. That catch helped his team get to the BCS Championship Game that season, although he contributed more than just one play during the season (seven starts, 28-325, two touchdowns; 198 rush yards). Louis started five games as a junior though his statistics didn't improve (21-261, three touchdowns; 220 yards, one rushing touchdown) because of a deep receiving corps including "Duke" Williams and Sammie Coates. With Williams dismissed during the 2015 season and Coates in the NFL, Louis got a chance to shine for pro scouts as a senior, making plays as the team's leading receiver (46-716, three scores; 158 yards, one rushing touchdown) despite the team's suddenly mediocre quarterback play.	Thickly built wide out with a frame comparable to a running back. Handled substantial workload increase with dismissal of Duke Williams. Former "catch­-and­-run" receiver who proved effective with more complex routes. Gets open downfield with crisp routes and acceleration out of his breaks. Uses leverage, head fakes and subtle directional change to separate. Makes first tackler miss and will finish his run with some pop. Ran sweeps in Auburn rush attack and showed good field vision as runner. Aware and effective with footwork near sideline. Second gear is present against cornerbacks on skinny posts.	Issues with focus drops and hauling in the tough, downfield catch with greater consistency. Gives away receptions by waiting rather than working back to throws allowing defenders to close and defend. Scheme created several openings in coverage he was able to exploit. Has route "tell" tied to stride length off the line. Stride much different off snap for deeper routes. On underneath routes, tries to push cornerbacks with arm churn over early acceleration.	\N	This past season was Louis' first opportunity to be more than just a "run after catch" option and he showed potential as a downfield option. Louis has good size and could help himself with a good 40 time at the combine, but he's still raw and his hands aren't consistent enough. It may take a little while, but I see enough upside in Louis to consider him a future NFL backup with some "big slot" potential.	"Don't see anything draftable about him. I don't like his routes and I don't like his hands. You like him better than me, I guess." -- NFC southeastern area scout	90	5.19000000000000039	ricardo-louis	\N
2555474	Byron	Marshall	4	69	201	9.5	One of the main cogs in the Oregon attack, Marshall accumulated 1,000 rushing yards in 2013 and 1,000 receiving yards in 2014 (earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice). However, he missed all but the first four games of 2015 with a leg injury, accumulating 121 yards and two touchdowns on nine catches. Former teammate De'Anthony Thomas was more explosive, but lasted until the fourth round of the 2014 draft due to his size; Marshall's thicker build might allow him to translate to the NFL more easily.	Gives teams a "manufactured touch" option. Played running back and receiver with Oregon getting him the ball from every spot on the field. Shows good initial burst off line of scrimmage to get a leg ­up against press coverage. Instant acceleration and early top end speed create vertical separation potential. Uses plus body control and mid­-air adjustments to win at the circus. Well-­built with ability to handle extended hand­off throws. Downhill kick returner who can challenge for a job.	Suffered serious ankle injury that ended his season in late September. Caught between third down back and slot receiver. Substantially behind in his route knowledge and experience. All separation created by athleticism over route savvy. Below-average sink into open spots of the zone. Settles in too close to zone defenders. Slow to find and track the deep throws. Hands inconsistent and unreliable.	\N	Marshall is relatively short, but muscular and has been productive as a running back, receiver and kick returner. While he's clearly been a jack of all trades type, he is simply not a master of any. Marshall's biggest assets are roster flexibility and general athleticism, but his ankle injury will have to check out in combine medicals for Marshall to have a shot at being drafted.	\N	48	5.16000000000000014	byron-marshall	\N
2555475	Jalin	Marshall	4	70	200	9.625	As a five-star recruit set to play in his home state, Marshall faced high expectations from Buckeyes fans. His transition from spectacular dual-threat quarterback to wide receiver was not immediate, however, as he redshirted the 2013 season due to injuries (including a concussion). He then tore a meniscus in spring practice, slowing his development a bit more. The payoff came in the team's national championship season of 2014, as he played in all 15 games as a reserve and was the team's second-leading receiver with 38 catches for 499 yards and six scores. Those freshman-year numbers, which were second only to Hall of Fame receiver Cris Carter in OSU's storied history, gained him Freshman All-American accolades. Marshall was also second on the team in receiving in 2015 and receiving honorable mention All-Big Ten honors as a receiver (36-477, five TD) and punt returner (28-379), before deciding to head to the next level.	Athletic with smooth hips and plus body control. Has feet to bound around initial tackler in space and can create after the catch. Good size for the slot, but gained experience on outside this season. Former dual-­threat high school quarterback who offers versatility on jet sweeps and packaged plays. Should continue to improve at the position with experience and coaching. Subtle and shifty in space. Able to run under the deep balls and is an excellent ball tracker. Excellent punt returner with 34.6 percent of his punts going for 15-plus yards.	Benefited from scheme. Stacks and bunch sets allowed for easier release. Must prove he can win against press man coverage. Routes are raw and rounded. Needs to do better job of working to softest spots against zone coverage. Smooth, but lacking instant burst component with all in his hands. Doesn't show the ball skills necessary to 50/50 balls or consistently finish contested throws. Hand strength is average. Struggles securing poorly thrown balls.	Keshawn Martin	Marshall is still learning as a receiver and should continue to improve with time, but is behind in quality of his routes and understanding the nuances of the position. He was recruited to Ohio State because he fit the Ohio State "H-­back" role, but will have to prove he can win on his own against more focused man coverage. While he learns the position, Marshall's punt return talent could get him on the field early.	"He's a running back playing in the slot. That's how I see it. I think he's just a guy. He might make a living as a punt returner, but he better get better at fielding short punts or he'll find the bench and then the waiver wire." -- Big Ten area scout	37	5.44000000000000039	jalin-marshall	\N
2555476	Marquez	North	4	74	223	10.25	North's talent was obvious in high school, as recruiting services ranked him among the top 10 receivers in the country and a four-star prospect. His athleticism was never in doubt, either, as he was the son of Ramando North, who played in the NFL and CFL and a member of the USA Track and Field Junior Olympic team running the 110-meter hurdles. And in his freshman season, it appeared North was destinated for SEC success. He started 11 games, catching 38 passes for 496 yards (ranking behind only Kelley Washington and Stanley Morgan in the UT books) and scoring once in a Freshman All-SEC campaign. He had a fair sophomore season (30-320, four TD), but then things started going south. He struggled with injuries at the end of the year, and tore his labrum in November. North could only manage six catches for 58 yards as a junior in 2015, starting the first four games but failing to stay on the field as injuries hampered him. Despite the maladies, North decided to declare for the 2016 draft to see if a change in scenery would allow his natural talent to shine.	Looks the part when he steps off the bus. Has NFL size and reliable, soft hands. Snatches ball away from his frame and gets upfield quickly after the catch. Extended catch radius with ability to adjust high, low or behind him to make the catch. Capable blocker to help spring running game on the perimeter.	Disappointing career with unimpressive production. Dealt with injuries every year in school including knee and back problems in 2015 limiting him to just seven games and six catches. Slow. Doesn't have feet to clear aggressive press coverage or the burst to get over the top. Uninspired route runner with average separation talent. Needs to work back to the ball.	\N	Highly regarded coming out of high school, North put together a solid freshman campaign but saw his production dwindle in each of the last two seasons. North has great size and hands, but his lack of speed and history of injuries could make him a camp project rather than a draftable talent.	\N	86	4.83000000000000007	marquez-north	\N
2555477	Charone	Peake	4	74	209	9.25	Named as one of the top 15 players in the country coming out of high school, big things were expected from Peake when he arrived at Death Valley. However, injuries and other rising stars (DeAndre Hopkins, Martavis Bryant and Sammy Watkins) held off his explosion on the scene until late in his career. Peake played in 14 games as a true freshman (4-71 receiving, 2-22 kick returns) and started two of 13 games played in a sophomore campaign (25-172, two TD receiving). Peake started the first two games of the 2013 season (8-84, one TD) before tearing his ACL in a September practice. He took a medical redshirt that season, and eventually made his way back onto the field the next season (four starts in seven games, 12-129, two TD receiving). Finally healthy and fully utilized with Deshaun Watson running an excellent Clemson offense that pushed the Tigers to the national championship game, Peake had the best year of his career in 2015 (50-716, five TD).	Possesses outstanding combination of size, length and deep speed. Looks the part of a WR1. Plays with consistent lean and acceleration into routes. Big athlete with some shake underneath to separate in tight quarters. Controlled strider after the catch with ability to hit top gear quickly on wide receiver screens and crossers. Is best when aggressively finishing catches against cornerbacks. Three-level potential as a pass catcher. Shows cornerbacks varied route speeds. Sells route at his top speed, but has another gear saved up to overtake defender when he hits the gas. Legitimate deep ball threat. Has potential to be dominant run blocker if he commits. Hard worker in the classroom and scouts love his personal character.	Hands are extremely small for his size and position. Late to get hands in catch­-ready position on intermediate throws. Dropped five passes for drop rate of 9.1 percent. Slows a bit on vertical routes when turning to find ball rather than maintaining top speed. Can improve working to open spaces against zone. Production never matched talent. Inconsistent in release success against press. Injuries are a major concern with two knee surgeries in his background.	Javon Walker	Rare combination of size and speed that can often be found in number one wide receivers. Peake was highly regarded coming out of high school but failed to post eye-­popping production thanks, in part, to two knee injuries. While his small hands are a concern, his athleticism and ability to operate on all levels of the field warrant consideration inside the first three rounds if his medicals check out.	"Like his size and speed but hands are dicey. Will work out well and get people excited." -- Southeastern area scout.	1	5.87999999999999989	charone-peake	\N
2555478	Demarcus	Robinson	4	73	203	9.5	Despite Robinson's athletic prowess, his ability to take advantage of those gifts, or to stay out of trouble, short-circuited his career in Gainesville. He was suspended four times with the Gators (twice in 2013), including once late in the 2015 season, to go along with two benchings in his final year on campus. The nephew of former South Carolina and NFL receiver Marcus Robinson, Demarcus was a major recruiting coup for the Gators as an all-state pick from Georgia. He played in only seven games as a freshman, though, due to two suspensions (5-23 receiving). Robinson took a step forward as a sophomore, catching 53 passes for 810 yards and seven touchdowns. His statistics dropped in 2015, however, as he played 13 games but could only manage 522 yards and two scores on 48 receptions as the Gators' offense struggled all season long.	Talent jumps off the tape early in the session. Electric vertical talent that can make cornerbacks re­think their coverage plans. Has shake at the line of scrimmage to free himself against press coverage and has adequate ball tracking skills. Graceful, flexible athlete with instant turbo acceleration. Has ability to hit the home run after the catch. Races off the line and forced cornerbacks into retreat opening easy comeback catches. Has talent and ability to make a living outside or from the slot.	Routes can be lazy at times. Will need to improve with selling fakes at break point of his routes as a pro. Too reliant on athleticism and speed over improvement of skill level. Hands are a concern with 11 drops to 106 catches at Florida. Plays smaller than his listed size. Suspended four times while at Florida. Scouts call him immature and selfish.	Mike Wallace	Immensely talented with elite combination of straight-­line speed and quick­-twitch athleticism. Robinson flashes game­-breaking potential as a deep ball threat and after the catch, but was suspended by two different coaches over a three-year period. While Robinson is likely to test off the charts and has the talent to be a top four receiver in this draft, it is hard to imagine his draft slot equaling his talent due to his character concerns.	"I think he's really, really talented but the guy has been suspended four times. You don't get drafted very high when you are 'Mr. Suspension'.

2555534	Tevin	Carter	17	73	218	9.25	It's easy to see why NFL scouts are interested in seeing Carter, as he is a physically imposing safety with excellent speed; in high school he was one of the top sprinters in Los Angeles and the state of California. He signed with Cal originally, but ended up at L.A. Southwest Junior College for two seasons (first team All-Conference both years) and attended El Camino College for one year to gain academic eligibility to play at Utah. After an injury-shortened 2014 season (two interceptions in four games played), Carter was the regular starter at strong safety this fall (56 tackles, 5.5 for loss, two interceptions, three pass breakups). Without a doubt, there will be NFL defensive coordinators wanting to make use of Carter's athleticism and physicality.	Big safety who rarely shortchanges himself when it is time to tackle. Possesses a great radar as tackler and lands powerful finishing blows wrapping, lifting and running feet through the hit. Former high school sprinter with decent straight line speed. Appears to have bone structure capable of taking on more weight for move to linebacker. Can sift through trash in the box and stick his nose in for the tackle. Highly recruited receiver out of high school still has winning ball skills on 50/50 passes. Has NFL traits that could be unlocked with more experience and coaching.	Top heavy with average build. Plodder in open field with borderline change of direction ability. Upright in space and seems to drift and wing it in coverage rather than playing with technique. Due to injury in 2014, has limited game experience in major college football. Limited lateral quickness due to hip tightness. Has build­up speed as a downhill player. Lacking instincts and route recognition expected from a former receiver.	James Sample	The individual pieces are more intriguing than the sum of those parts at this time. Carter is a terrific tackler who combines attitude and technique for memorable finishes. His cover skills and technique are a bit of a mess as a safety, but he?s still raw and moldable. Carter tackles like a linebacker and could be considered as a box-­only safety with potential to move to linebacker if he can add good weight.	\N	80	5.17999999999999972	tevin-carter	\N
2555479	Alonzo	Russell	4	76	206	9.5	Although Russell was one of the top high school receivers in the Washington D.C. metro area, he struggled to meet the academic requirements needed to play college ball. After attending a prep academy, he walked onto the Toledo campus as a regular student and eventually earned the right to play. Once he did, he showed his talent, being voted on the coaches' All-MAC squad all four of his collegiate seasons, three times on the third team before moving up to grab second-team honors in 2015. As a redshirt freshman, he caught 56 passes for a career-high 960 yards and five scores. He caught 59 passes for 728 yards and six touchdowns as a sophomore, 51 for 770 and eight scores in 2014, and finished off his career with 36 receptions for 618 yards and five touchdowns.	Tall with good weight and arm length and ability to add more muscle. Drops hips and opens very quickly to find the ball on comebacks. Does his best work in intermediate game working back to throws in space. Lulls defenders with varied route speed when working the middle of the field. Had some issues with drops this year, but appears to be natural hands catcher. Ball winner down the field with great high point and ball tracking. Shows some route savvy in his work.	Too eager to test his luck with contested catches rather than stacking cornerbacks on his hip for easier grabs. Doesn't have much juice into routes off snap and a quality press can hinder him. Inconsistent in his play speed and is unable to create consistent separation with underneath routes. Not as committed to blocking as he should be with his size. Scouts say he found coaches' dog­house while at Toledo.	Dontrelle Inman	Smooth receiver with the size NFL teams covet for an outside receiver, but scouts have lingering questions about his toughness over the middle and lack of improvement during his time at Toledo. Russell saw 83.3 percent of his catches go for first downs this year and looks very natural when he gets into a rhythm. If he runs well, his draft stock may warm up, but he's likely a Day 3 draft target who will fight for a backup spot.	"When a player with his height, weight, speed doesn't get any better from his first year you really have to wonder what is going on.

2555480	Rashawn	Scott	4	73	199	9.375	Scott had difficulty staying on the field during his time with the Hurricanes. He missed parts of the 2011 (one catch for two yards in six games) and 2013 (3-38 in four games) seasons and all of 2014 with collarbone and shoulder injuries. Scott also faced multiple suspensions for violating team rules, missing the final three games of a strong 2012 campaign (35-512, three touchdowns in nine games) and being kept home from the Russell Athletic Bowl in 2013. Somehow, it all came together for Scott in his fifth year, as he garnered third-team All-ACC recognition with 52 receptions for 695 yards and five scores. He must show maturity and health during the pre-draft process if teams are to use a draft pick to secure his services.	Former high school track man who comes out of the starting blocks with great forward lean off the snap and into his routes. Salesman on comeback routes charging out at full speed to force cornerbacks into defensive posture. Hand fighter who fights back against corners trying to crowd him against the boundary. Has some untapped talent that might intrigue teams.	Can't stay healthy. Missed 2011 and 2014 and parts of two other seasons with shoulder or collarbone issues. Maturity has been a concern for chunks of his time at Miami. Made first start ever this season. Routes lack discipline and crispness. Body catcher with poor hands. Has 16 drops to just 90 catches for his career. Drop rate of 13.3 percent was worst for starters in ACC this season.	\N	Possesses enough size and speed to get a look, but red flags with maturity and injuries will be concerns for just about every NFL team and that is before you work your way to his poor hands. Could find his way into a camp but will have a tough battle to win a spot.	"Well, he has some edge to him. He has some traits, but I don't know if you can trust his character or his health. I doubt we will consider him based on his history of injuries." -- NFC East area scout	23	4.91999999999999993	rashawn-scott	\N
2555481	De'Runnya	Wilson	4	77	224	9.25	Wilson was a basketball star who moonlighted as a receiver for his senior season, much to his coach's delight (31-682, seven TD receiving). Despite lacking any knowledge of how to really play the position, and not even being sure he wanted to play football, the Bulldogs put him out on the field as a true freshman. He collected 26 passes for 351 yards and three scores, learning along the way. Wilson starting 10 games in 2014, catching 47 passes for 680 yards and nine scores (including 9-105, two TD vs Orange Bowl against Georgia Tech). SEC coaches recognized his continued improvement in his third and final season with the Bulldogs, voting him second team all-conference after he started all 13 games, making 60 grabs for 918 yards and 10 touchdowns. Again he came up big in a bowl game, catching five throws for 96 yards and a touchdown in the Belk Bowl against North Carolina State.	Tight, controlled stride length into routes for a tall, leggy receiver. Battles through with hand fighting and strength. Clears out route squatters with physicality. Extraordinary catch radius. Combines height and length like giant net to snare would­-be incompletions. Confident hands catcher. Almost 77 percent of his catches went for first downs. Former hooper with superb ball skills on fades and downfield 50/50s. Bodies defender pre-­catch to take control and high-­points over the top. Legitimate red zone weapon. Size and contested catch ability a plus. Lacks consistency, but able to force cornerbacks out of the picture as run blocker.	Mechanical and stiff with below average movement in space. Play speed is off. Shows no vertical speed to separate over the top relying only on size. Upright into breaks leading to rounded turns over crisp cuts. Fails to sell routes with fakes and speed variance. Maybe too aware of safeties when working the middle. Hard to spot a second gear and plays with very little separation quickness on any level of the field.	Darren Waller	Wilson might have to find work in a play­-action based passing attack that takes advantage of his size and ball skills down the field and allows for an ability to uncover through scheme. He doesn't have long speed to keep cornerbacks at bay or the the acceleration out of breaks to open passing windows as a possession receiver. Wilson might never be a volume target option, but his size and ability to score touchdowns in the red zone creates draft value.	"Very limited but he scores touchdowns, and he's really big so he can play in the league." -- AFC wide receivers coach	92	5.44000000000000039	derunnya-wilson	\N
2555482	Ben	Braunecker	5	75	250	9.5	The last four players drafted from Harvard enjoyed at least some NFL success, from long-time starting center Matt Birk to special teams ace Isaiah Kacyvenski to veteran starting quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to the Ravens versatile fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Braunecker (and his teammate, offensive tackle Cole Toner) could be next on the draft list after an All-American (AP, Walter Camp, AFCA) senior season with the Crimson. The first team All-Ivy League selection caught 48 passes for 850 yards and eight touchdowns (including four 100-yard games in the last six weeks), easily outdistancing his production as a sophomore (9-91, one touchdown) and junior (11-227, one touchdown).	Physical and mean as a blocker. Plays with good knee bend and hip explosion as in­line blocker. Blocks to and thru the whistle and completely overwhelmed many of his opponents. Accelerates into routes with good push and is able to sink and cut with sharpness. Effective route adjustment against contact downfield. Understands how to use leverage to create space in his routes. Carries himself with some attitude.	Was physically overwhelming much smaller players on the perimeter. Might not have anywhere near same success as a blocker against bigger, stronger opposition. Gets a little lazy with routes at times. Hands in traffic appear to be just average. Allows throws into his frame. Needs to do better job of settling into space and protecting throws with his frame. Game could use a little more finesse.	Ryan Hewitt	Was clearly too big and physical for many of the defenders who tried to stop him. Braunecker looks to have just average speed, but we will find out for sure at the combine. He lacks desired size as an in­line tight end, but is a perfect fit as a move tight end that is able to block from a variety of angles and still help in the passing game. Braunecker's physicality and confidence is appealing, but can he make the big step up?	\N	231	5.23000000000000043	ben-braunecker	\N
2555483	Thomas	Duarte	5	74	231	\N	NFL scouts don't care one bit about the ethnicity of college football prospects; it's the ultimate color-blind evaluation because either guys can play, have the potential to become players in time, or just don?t have the necessary skill set. Duarte's growing up in a household with Mexican and Japanese influences give him a unique background, but scouting his outstanding skill set as a playmaking receiver is what interests general managers across the league. The four-star wide receiver recruit from successful Mater Dei High School (where his number was retired) jumped into the fray as a true freshman, playing in 13 games with four starts and garnering honorable mention All-Pac-12 (16-214, four TD). Duarte was picked as honorable mention all-conference selection again in 2014, leading the conference with an average 19.3 yards per reception from the tight end position (28-540, four TD). Joining forces with freshman phenom quarterback Josh Rosen last season, Duarte became a second-team all-conference pick by catching 10 touchdowns among his 53 catches that covered 872 yards (16.5 per).	Glider. Able to create early defender leans with his route work. Has hips to swerve into change of direction creating separation inside red area and can sink into breaks and make razor­-sharp cuts inside his routes. Has burst out of break points to uncover against safeties and slot corners. Able and willing to work the middle. Doesn?t scare easily.	'Tweener size. Scouts worry he can?t get big enough to become matchup/move tight end. Routes can be disrupted by contact in space. Production bolstered by unguarded looks and catches on air. Didn't have to face dedicated coverage he'll see in pros. Needs to catch over corral. Disinterested as blocker.	Jordan Reed	Duarte is an interesting study as his draft value and overall grade could be tied directly to whether or not a team believes they can make him work as move tight end. Duarte has the athleticism, size and play speed to make a roster as a wide receiver, but his draft value may not be as high if teams see him as a receiver only. Matchup tight ends are all the rage and Duarte can play with more weight and a little more willingness as a run blocker, he?s got a shot to become a productive NFL player.	\N	52	5.65000000000000036	thomas-duarte	\N
2555485	David	Grinnage	5	77	248	10.125	Though his teammate, Jaylen Samuels, was the one garnering All-Conference mentions, Grinnage was a solid contributor for the Wolfpack the past three seasons. He started seven of 12 games played in his redshirt freshman season (15-150, one touchdown) and then earned 11 starts in his sophomore campaign, catching 27 passes for 358 yards while tying for the team lead with five touchdown receptions. Though he only started six times in 2015, Grinnage still played a role in quarterback Jacoby Brissett's offense, nabbing 25 catches for 290 yards and three scores.	Has size of an NFL tight end. Productive pass catcher as redshirt sophomore. Sacrificed personal stats for team goals with no complaints. Works to free himself into presentable position when quarterback scrambles. Showed improved focus at the catch­-point this season. Able to adjust to low throws and peel them off the turn.	Below average speed and athleticism on tape. Upright into breaks and was unable to uncover and open passing windows. Routes lack sharpness and opens to quarterback too gradually. Limited run skills after the catch. Wasn?t tasked with heavy­ lifting as a run blocker and may not be able to execute blocking responsibilities as "Y" tight end. Missed spring practices due to back issue.	\N	There was pre­season buzz surrounding Grinnage after a productive 2014 campaign, but this season's results were somewhat disappointing and completely lacking in consistency of production. Grinnage plays with below-average play speed and stiffness in his routes. His difficulty separating combined with very average run blocking will pose a substantial hurdle in his attempts to make an NFL roster.	\N	6	4.91999999999999993	david-grinnage	\N
2555486	Temarrick	Hemingway	5	77	244	\N	Hemingway is not your typical tight end prospect. But his frame, fluidity and pass-receiving ability make him an intriguing threat worth developing. Hemingway earned first-team All-MEAC honors in 2015 as the Bulldogs' second-leading receiver, making 38 receptions for 418 yards and one touchdown. This was not the first year that Hemingway was a major contributor in the passing game, as he put up decent numbers as a freshman (11-164, one TD), garnered third-team All-MEAC notice as a sophomore (26-223, four TD), and first-team accolades as a junior (18-257, one TD).	Fluid, graceful gait with long, easy strides. Has short area movement like a basketball player. Nightmare matchup for linebackers with his whip routes and whip counters underneath. Has legitimate separation quickness. Raw, but moldable athlete. Gets off the snap and into his routes in a hurry. Can stop and open up with suddenness. Physical runner after the catch. Poor quarterback play slighted his true production potential.	Has lean frame that screams wide receiver over tight end. Not close to possessing the play strength needed to block on NFL level. Head ducker into contact and allows hands to spray wide of defenders framework. Route work was extremely limited and will require extended work on next level. Hands are suspect. Had issues with double catches and scouts question toughness to secure throws with looming safety nearby.	Wes Saxton	Intriguing vertical potential as matchup­-based tight end, but his lack of play strength and route running experience could make him a long­-term project if he is ever to become a true NFL contributor.	\N	368	5	temarrick-hemingway	\N
2555487	Beau	Sandland	5	76	253	10.125	This California native didn't get much play as a high school recruit, so he stayed in-state to play at two-year Pierce College. By the time he was wrapping up an all-conference season at Pierce (24-267, three TD), schools from all over the country were interested in his services. He chose to fly across the country to Miami, Florida, to follow in the footsteps of many top-rated tight ends. But after one season (9-94 receiving in 13 games), Sandland decided he would rather attend a school closer to his home environment. He sat out the 2014 season transferring to FCS program Montana State. With a year in the offense under his belt, Sandland's game took off in 2015, as he earned All-American honors from the Associated Press and first-team All-Big Sky notice with 37 catches for 632 yards and nine scores. Even with just one good season at the junior college level and another for a FCS team, NFL scouts are intrigued enough with his skill set to make sure he was invited to the NFL Scouting Combine.	Athletic frame with good mass and room for more. Exceptional arm length and hand size for the position. Capable seam worker. Long strides in vertical routes can overtake squatting safeties. Able to separate out of breaks. Competitive, able runner after catch. Run blocking was a requirement. Has lateral footwork to become workable in­line blocker for zone runs and has the experience and hand strength to get early block security.	Slow to make route adjustments against contact. Relies on size and athleticism over crisp routes to overcome lesser competition. Inconsistent as run blocker. Base narrows causing lack of balance to sustain. Still learning to take proper angles up to the second level in run game. Played JUCO ball and then sparingly at Miami (Fla.) before transferring in 2014. Limited experience against high-­end athletes.	Vance McDonald	Sandland was the top-­rated JUCO tight end when he signed with Miami (Fla.) so NFL teams are very aware of his potential. While he is thought of as a pass-­catching tight end, Sandland was required to put in work in the trenches which gives him a small head­ start on some of the tight ends coming out. With an ability to challenge down the field and separate underneath, Sandland has a chance to work his way onto a roster and into some snaps by his second season.	\N	294	5.38999999999999968	beau-sandland	\N
2555488	Caleb	Benenoch	7	77	305	\N	The son of two Nigerian ministers started his football career accidentally, and his mother thought she had signed him up for soccer when he was nine after they moved to Katy, Texas from Nigeria. Had she known how football-crazy their new home was, she probably would have known better. But it all worked out great for Benenoch, whose build is much better suited for the gridiron than the pitch. The Bruins convinced the four-star recruit to leave Texas for southern California, and rewarded him with immediate playing time. He started the last nine games of his true freshman season at right tackle, garnering second-team All-American notice and the team?s Rookie of the Year award on offense. Benenoch was named honorable mention All-Pac-12 as a sophomore, starting all 13 games at right tackle, and then proved invaluable in his versatility as a junior, starting nine times at tackle and four at guard. NFL teams will differ on whether his best fit is inside or outside at the next level, but either way his talent is worth an investment.	Plays with good knee bend. Above average athlete with long arms. Has lateral quickness off the snap to put himself in position for difficult zone blocks. Able to get to backside cut­off blocks when his angles are right. Has feet to mirror in space in pass protection. Aggressive worker with some recovery athleticism to work himself back into the play. Bumped inside to guard due to injury issues on team and handled his duties effectively.	Has thin hips and lack of natural base. Lacks core strength and functional power to pin blocks to completion once he gains advantage. Way too much waist-­bending as a tackle. Leans into pass rushers opening up balance concerns. Needs to bring hands back inside with his punch. Opens the gate early in pass pro and tends to overreact when shifting his weight to defend against bursts upfield or back inside.	\N	Athletic prospect with some roster value as a tackle or guard, but concerns about his play strength could be an issue at either spot. Benenoch's tape at guard may have been better than his tackle tape, but moving inside requires more mass and power. Benenoch has the makeup of an NFL backup with potential to work into a lineup for a zone­-scheme team.	\N	52	5.15000000000000036	caleb-benenoch	\N
2555493	Alex	Redmond	6	77	294	10.5	Redmond's career with the Bruins started off strong, but didn't end as well as maybe he had hoped. A four-star high school recruit who also excelled as a wrestler, he forced his way onto the field as a true freshman. He started all 13 games at right guard, winning Freshman All-American, honorable mention All-Conference, and team Rookie of the Year honors. Redmond started eight games at guard in 2014, again named honorable mention All-Pac-12, but losing some playing time with a leg injury and failing to immediately regain his spot when healthy due to the play of his replacement. To finish his career with the Bruins, he played in 12 games, starting 10 inside, but missed the team's bowl game after being declared academically ineligible.	Fluid and athletic out of his stance. Moves well in space and is able to block angles as a pulling guard that many guards can't. Instinctive and intelligent on the field. Sifts through moving bodies and can adjust his block targets accordingly. Anticipates twists and responds to them with well-­timed passing of first block. Plays with quiet, tight punch inside defender's frame and can crank some jolt into it when he wants.	Linear frame missing the girth of an NFL guard. Play strength and functional power will be his biggest challenge as a pro. Must find training table and weight room. On run plays, weight gets too far out over his feet causing him to whiff against a side­step. Base gets too narrow in run and pass games. Loses leverage in space when pad level rises. Might not have the anchor drop necessary to brace up against NFL bull rushers.	Cody Wallace	Redmond is a very good athlete for the guard position but may not have the strength or frame to stick long term even with a zone scheme team. He has some talent and field intelligence and his best chance might be to continue to add as much bulk as he can and then try and make the move inside as a zone-scheme center with range.	"I would say he shouldn?t have come out, but I'm hearing he was having issues in school which is why he did it. That?s important because we need to know if he's intelligent or if he has work ethic issues that are pro concerns. He's athletic but weak. Late round at best." -- Pac-12 area scout	52	5.04000000000000004	alex-redmond	\N
2555489	Joseph	Cheek	6	78	295	9.25	Cheek is a legacy prospect for NFL scouts, as his father Louis played four years in the NFL with four teams after being chosen in the eighth round by the Miami Dolphins. Louis also played at A&amp;M, winning three titles in the old Southwest Conference under famed coach Jackie Sherrill. The younger Cheek grew into a starting spot at right guard over the course of the career. He redshirted in 2011, playing in every game on field goal/special teams units, and then played a reserve role in 2013 as Johnny Manziel ran all over the SEC. Cheek finally got his chance in 2014, playing in every game and starting nine at right guard, and then followed that up with a strong year as the full-time starter at the position as a senior.	Athletic guard asked to play in space and at a high rate of speed in Texas A&amp;M's offense. Well-conditioned. Aware and ready against twists, passing blocks off and picking up the incoming. Has experience at both tackle and guard. Shows good timing to secure and climb with combo blocks. Plays with good body control in space and can find moving targets. Father played offensive tackle for four years in the NFL.	Play strength is a concern. Plays with narrow base and gives ground against power. Contact balance is an issue. Struggles to sustain blocks and won't consistently secure as base-blocker. Is often late with his hands. More likely to catch rather than punch in pass protection. Likely relegated to zone scheme consideration only.	\N	Cheek is built like a tackle, but played guard at Texas A&amp;M thanks in large part to the outstanding tackle talent that has come through the program. Cheek's lack of play strength could limit his draft prospects as a guard, but his stock could be helped out quite a bit if teams work him out as a tackle and like what they see.	\N	20	5	joseph-cheek	\N
2555490	Darrell	Greene	6	75	321	9.625	This Georgia native had started 25 straight games at right guard for the Aztecs heading into the 2015 season and was poised to make a name for himself with NFL scouts. Greene made headlines for the wrong reason, however, as SDSU head coach Rocky Long suspended him along with four other players for six games after positive tests for marijuana. Contrite for his mistake, Greene came back to start the final seven games of the year, helping the team produce two 1000-yard rushers for the first time in school history. The 2014 honorable mention All-Mountain West selection will have to answer the same questions about the suspension again and again during the pre-draft process, but also has enough good tape to make teams take the time to consider his talent.	Thick ball of power. Has broad shoulders and and a lower body made for mashing. Able to generate early movement with initial punch and completes job with leg drive. Tape shows several plays where defenders are torqued to the ground by Greene?s tremendous power. Plays with a mean streak. Completely erases defenders with wash blocks and down blocks. Effective combo blocker with decent timing up to the linebacker. Has enough athleticism to be used as pulling guard. Works to mirror and stay engaged to pass rushers.	Squatty with short arms. Upright lateral mover as zone blocker making cross-­face blocks challenging. General flexibility in lower half may never be ideal. Iffy radar when asked to strike moving targets in space. In pass protection, can be a little slow to see twists at times and impatience causes him to lunge. Teams will dig deep into background after six-game suspension levied by NCAA due to positive drug test.	Shaq Mason	Stocky, prototypical right guard with the power to unclog running lanes and help a rushing attack looking to dominate with the physical over the finesse. Greene lacks the length NFL teams usually look for but his tremendous power could be an off­set. His NCAA suspension for drugs will be heavily vetted before teams decide to pull the trigger on Greene, but the power and NFL ability is there.	"He got clipped by the NCAA for the weed, but he's not considered a bad kid in that building at all. They go to bat for him over there." -- West Coast area scout	78	5.51999999999999957	darrell-greene	\N
2555491	Denver	Kirkland	7	76	335	9.625	Razorback running backs Alex Collins and Jonathan Williams received a fair amount of publicity for their efforts the past three years, but Kirkland's power up front helped lead the way for their consistent production. One of the top offensive line recruits in the country coming out of Miami, Kirkland chose the country life in Fayetteville. He was rewarded with eight games at guard and Freshman All-American honors in 2013. He started all 13 games at right guard the following year, and then moved to left tackle in 2015, starting 12 of 13 games played before deciding to leave Arkansas early to become an NFL prospect.	Three-year starter. Massive, hulking frame. Good worker on gap plays climbing up to linebacker and securing the inside shoulder. Uses strong, short punch to the chest. Lands punch squarely and shows enough hand strength to sustain. Not a graceful athlete but able to find the best angles up to the second level. Tough guy willing to play hurt. Offers position and roster flexibility.	Head dropper as run and pass blocker. Won't always see what he?s aiming at. Serial waist-­bender. Pass pro punch comes with a forward lean tied to it. Can't sink his hips for anchor befitting his size. Doesn't have the skill or athleticism to protect quarterback as a tackle. Top heavy frame an even greater issue with his poor weight displacement. Too content to stalemate rather than win his rep. Won't generate much push as run blocker. Tall and stiff as space blocker.	Cyril Richardson	Despite the massive frame, Kirkland's play lacks a consistency of power due to his waist-­bending and subsequent balance issues. If Kirkland could correct his leaning and balance issues, he might unlock his true power potential at guard, but that may not happen. Kirkland?s size and experience at two positions help his roster chances, but he isn't ready for NFL reps yet.	"Those issues with waist bending and head ducking are very hard to correct. You can try and work around one of them, but if a guy has both of them then it is a big concern." -- NFC offensive line coach	89	5.05999999999999961	denver-kirkland	\N
2555492	Tyler	Marz	7	79	316	\N	Wisconsin's starting left tackle the past three seasons, Marz was given honorable mention All-Big Ten notice in 2013 and 2014, and third-team recognition in his senior season due to his strength and footwork in the run game. He started 40 straight games for the Badgers, showing great durability and consistency while leading the way for running backs like 2015 first-round pick Melvin Gordon and giving quarterback Joel Stave enough time to make plays.	Three-year starter. Shoots his punch with decent timing and placement. Scans for blitz possibilities and processes post snap movements quickly to assess his task. Not the quickest pass sets, but finds his way in front of rusher. Looks for work down the field.	Plays with little knee bend and his upright pass sets get him knocked back into the pocket by even average bull rushes. Consistent leaner who struggles to sustain and secure without falling off blocks. Doesn't possess athletic qualities to climb and get cut­off blocks. Issues with core strength and bend will always plague contact balance.	\N	Despite his three-year run as a starter in a quality conference, Marz might not check the strength and athleticism boxes to make an NFL roster. At some point, he might be asked to move inside to guard or maybe even center due to his limitations.	\N	40	4.83999999999999986	tyler-marz	\N
2555552	Ryan	Smith	14	71	189	8.875	Major schools missed on this guy. The Maryland Big School All-State honorable mention pick has been a fixture in the NCCU secondary since arriving on campus, starting at least eight games each season. He tied for the FCS lead with four fumble recoveries as a freshman, while also intercepting three pases and breaking up five others. Smith had two interceptions, three pass breakups as a sophomore, recovering three more fumbles. Although he lacked a pick as a junior, he led the team with seven breakups in 2014. He starred as a senior for the Eagles, garnering second team All-MEAC honors as a cornerback (two INT, nine PBU) and returner (28.1 yards per kick return, one touchdown). Smith also accomplished something you don?t hear very often; he set the team career record for solo tackles with 168 as a cornerback.	Gets a solid pop in for his initial chuck at the line of scrimmage. Very smooth in his pedal and turn and does a nice job of reading a receiver's "tells" within his route. Quality footwork for mirror and match and sticks to the hip of his man. Plays with good balls skills and consistently turns to find the ball from man. In zone, slides according to quarterback's eyes restricting passing Windows. Works through combo routes and comes out on right side. Not big and strong, but isn?t soft either.	Needs advanced instincts and to take coverage chances because closing burst is just marginal. Average long speed in the chase. Can be stacked and big-­boyed on vertical routes creating difficulties playing the ball. Small hands at the end of his short arms. Acceleration from change of direction is below average. Skinny and will always be challenged by size. Ankle­-biter as a tackler.	Bill Bentley	A little small for the perimeter, but worth a consideration from the slot. Smith has cover skills and the short area footwork to challenge for a roster spot matching up against full­-time slot receivers. Smith doesn't have great size and doesn't appear to have the speed or twitch that teams look for, but his tape shows a player with enough skill to warrant a look.	\N	315	5.30999999999999961	ryan-smith	\N
2555494	Dominique	Robertson	7	77	324	10.375	Robertson has gone from junior college to major college football to Division II over the past three years, but scouts saw enough of his talent in those places to make sure he was invited to the 2016 Scouting Combine. He was named first-team All-Gulf South and was mentioned on multiple Division II All-American teams after a successful season at left tackle with the Wolves, with the team advancing to the national semi-finals. Robertson played one season at Texas Tech, but only managed to get on the field for four games, at part due to a concussion. Tech won a recruiting battle to get him out of Riverside Community College, where he was an all-conference performer in 2013.	Broad frame with proportional thickness. Protracted arm length. Candidate to bump inside and has the hip explosion and leg drive to give it a go. Extremely athletic for his size with plus lateral foot quickness and the ability to get to reach blocks. Keeps head out of pass sets and shows almost no waist-­bending.	Dwarfed many of the defensive ends he faced. Faced a lack of quality pass rushers and power players to give him needed competition. Catches rather than punches. Hands drift a little wide. The good initial bend turns into straight-­legged pass blocking at contact. Anchor might be an issue.	\N	The sheer mass, length and athleticism of Robertson was appealing enough that Texas Tech signed him from junior college, but he never did enough to break in with them before transferring. While Robertson has some dominant snaps against some of the competition he faced this season, he?s extremely raw and nothing more than a project with traits at this point.	\N	436	4.90000000000000036	dominique-robertson	\N
2555495	Isaac	Seumalo	6	76	303	9.875	It's a family affair at Oregon State for the Seumalos. Isaac's brother, Andrew, was a captain at defensive tackle for the Beavers and was a graduate assistant coach. His father, Joe, was the defensive line coach (but has since moved on to BYU), and his sister, Jessi, plays volleyball in Corvallis. Isaac was the most highly recruited of any of them, rated as a top five guard prospect nationally out of high school. It was no surprise, therefore, that he suited up in the middle as a true freshman, earning honorable mention All-Pac-12 honors and multiple Freshman All-American nods. He showed versatility in 2013, garnering second team All-Pac-12 recognition for starting 10 games at center and two at right tackle due to injuries at that position. Unfortunately, Seumalo suffered a broken foot in the 2013 Hawai'i Bowl, which needed multiple surgeries to correct. He missed the entire 2014 season, although he still was named a team captain. Finishing off his career, Seumalo started all 12 games in 2015, nine at right guard, three at left tackle, meaning that he has started in four of the five spots on the line.	Quick feet and plays with above average lateral movement. Well­-schooled with technician's understanding of footwork and angles to secure reach blocks and wall defenders out of the running lane. Patient blocker waiting for his feet to settle into place before engaging. Operates with a centered, sure base and reliable core strength. Has experience at center, right guard and both tackle spots. Unselfish and does what is asked of him. Pass sets look like a tackle's with desired knee bend, flat back and arm extension.	Frame could use more mass. Base narrows as drive blocker causing occasional bouts with body control and balance. Doesn't appear to have punch-­and­-snatch hands. Looks like he's got block secured and then loses grip and allows his defender into the play. Defender's hands often first into the framework. Hands need to work faster. Missed 2014 due to complications from injury suffered in 2013 Hawaii Bowl.	Tim Lelito	Seumalo proved that he was back from a foot injury that sidelined him for all of 2014 with the same foot quickness and technical talent that he had before his injury. Seumalo can play anywhere on the interior, but his best position might be at center thanks to his core strength and overall anchor.	\N	49	5.44000000000000039	isaac-seumalo	\N
2555496	Pearce	Slater	7	79	333	\N	A mountain of a man, Slater played two years at El Camino College coming out of high school. Though he wasn't considered a high-level Juco prospect after his time there, Slater made a great impact in San Diego. He used his length and strength to step into a starting role at right tackle for the Aztecs in 2014, lining up for all 13 contests. Mountain West coaches recognized his play last fall, naming him first-team all-conference for his work at right tackle in all 14 games on SDSU's schedule. Slater hopes his success over the past two seasons results in a mid-round draft selection, like it did former teammate Terry Poole, who was a fourth-round pick by Seattle in 2015.	Mountain of a man who can block out the sun on day games. Not a dancing bear, but has lighter feet than expected. Long arms to get into defensive ends first. Tough to get a quick disengage when he's snatched and locked. Despite athletic disadvantages, works hard to sustain backside zone blocks by running his feet. Few issues climbing up to seal MIKE linebacker in run game.	Upright and stiff in his kick­ slide. Asking him to protect an NFL quarterback could be reckless. Allowed 4.5 sacks and eight quarterback knock­downs. Charged with five holding penalties in 2015. Doesn't possess enough lateral quickness to successfully execute many reach blocks no matter how basic the angle. Not a natural knee­-bender and might lack flexibility to bump inside successfully. Plays with a narrow base as drive blocker.	Tayo Fabuluje	With a massive frame, long arms and moderate movement skills for his size, Slater has a better than average chance of making an NFL roster. However, to become anything more than a novelty due to his size, he may need to prove he can move inside to guard where his size would become an advantage rather than a liability at the tackle spot.	"He's a big, lumbering tackle and those guys make it on some rosters, but you never want them to have to start. I need to watch him more." -- AFC offensive line coach	78	5.11000000000000032	pearce-slater	\N
2555497	Avery	Young	7	77	328	10.5	When Young enters the NFL, he'll find some familiar faces waiting to greet him. He is the younger brother of NFL defensive end Willie Young, and the cousin of Carolina Panthers Pro Bowl linebacker Thomas Davis. Not that he can't make his own way in the league, as the former top 10 offensive tackle national recruit earned his starting job at right tackle as a true freshman in 2012, although shoulder surgery put him on the shelf after three games, causing him to take a medical redshirt year. In 2013, Young began the season as a backup before starting the final nine games at right tackle when full healthy. Coaches moved him around quite a bit in his sophomore campaign, as he started at right guard the first four games due to injuries on the line, then moved to left guard for one game, then to right tackle for seven contests, before heading back to left guard for the Outback Bowl. In his final season on the plains, Young finished strong by starting all but one game (Jacksonville State, ankle) at right tackle.	Big bubble rear that he can sink to help him anchor when being bull­ rushed. Has starting experience at both guard spots and right tackle. Shows some lightness of feet. Capable and effective in short-­pull situations as guard. Does a decent job of working feet into position to help secure his block. Athletic enough to operate at guard or tackle as zone blocker.	Has habit of ducking head into blocks. Struggles with changing direction against inside moves. Opens post leg and leans into redirect block rather than stepping back inside to slam the door shut. Balance and body control are below average. Doesn't have agility to gain enough ground with kick slides against edge rushers as tackle. Punch is sluggish and hands too wide. Gives away chest too often.	\N	The temptation will be to try Young as a right tackle, but his lack of necessary lateral agility could end up getting the quarterback hit too often. Young's athleticism and length are appealing as a guard, but his inability to sustain blocks with body control and power at the point of attack could make him a backup to low­-end starter in the league.	\N	90	5.24000000000000021	avery-young	\N
2555498	Mehdi	Abdesmad	9	78	284	9.75	NFL scouts weren't the only ones impressed with the play of Mehdi Abdesmad (meh-DEE ab-des-MAHD) during the 2015 season. The Canadian Football League's Scouting Bureau ranked him the fourth-best Canadian-born prospect in their list released in December 2015. Abdesmad's play as a senior was good enough to earn honorable mention All-ACC notice from league coaches (49 tackles, 15 for loss, 5.5 sacks), but it was especially impressive given his battle with injuries the previous two years. He played a total of seven games, with five starts, (21 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks) over the 2013 and 2014 seasons due to problems with his left knee. He had made a positive impression in his first two years on campus, playing in eight games (missed the final three due to injury) in 2011 and starting eight games in 2012 (25 tackles, three for loss).	Has imposing size from the end position. When he gets hands on blockers first, can drive them off the ball and make stops right at the line of scrimmage or behind it. Decent finisher once he gets ahead of an offensive lineman. Has shoulder turn and upper body flexibility to help turn corner as a rusher. Upper body strength is there. Able to play the game on his feet. Rarely stalls as rusher continuing to move his feet looking to improve positioning.	High-cut, top-heavy frame. Played just seven games over 2013 and 2014 campaigns thanks to consecutive season­-ending knee injuries in each season. Sloppy and basic with hands. Allows blockers into his framework first and doesn't control the point of attack with strong punch and struggles to win the hand game as pass rusher. Pops straight up off the snap. Pursuit motor doesn't carry enough gas for the long haul. Has no pass rush plan, just a swim move that is countered too easily.	Ropati Pitoitua	Abdesmad is an intriguing prospect due to his size and impact tackle production. He's big and strong enough, but his poor pad level and hand usage prevents him from reaching his full potential. While his knees have been an issue in the past, he looked unaffected this season and could become a rotational tackle/end for a 3-­4 team.	"I thought he moved around pretty well this year, but I'm worried for him that those knees aren't going to check out in combine medicals. If they do, he has a shot." -- NFC scout	22	5.04999999999999982	mehdi-abdesmad	\N
2555499	Sterling	Bailey	9	76	285	10.25	Although Bailey didn't put up statistics that you would expect from a top 10 defensive end recruit out of high school, he was a solid player and good leader for the Bulldogs the past couple of seasons. He capped his time in Athens by winning a Coaches' Leadership Award as a 10-game starter (46 tackles, two for loss, sack). Bailey had also been a regular starter as a redshirt sophomore (eight starts, 34 tackles, sack) before going to a reserve role in 2014 (27 stops, half-sack). Despite his lack of production, NFL teams saw enough of his strength on the edge that they invited him to participate in the NFL Scouting Combine.	Tough guy with impressive power at the point of attack. Plays with excellent technique. Has powerful legs and hands and gets plus arm extension to set the strong edge. Terrific feel for double teams anchoring his back leg like a door jamb to maintain his gap. Rarely beaten in the leverage game. Strikes, lifts and snaps hips at battle point. Leader on the defensive side of the ball. Played up and down the defensive line this season.	Slow-twitch edge defender. Lacks explosiveness off the snap to penetrate and disrupt and is too slow and stiff to consistently range beyond the box to make takes. Marginal pass rusher relying on force over skill. Got home with just 2.5 sacks total while at Georgia. Tough but lacking optimal bulk to handle full-time interior work as a pro.	\N	Run plugger who lacks the athleticism to play on the edge or the bulk to be a natural fit inside. In a perfect world, Bailey would be an ideal fit for a base 3­-4 team looking for help against the run. 4­-3 teams looking for a strong base­ end with toughness to squeeze the run could be an option. Bailey has almost no value as a pass rusher, but he's a tough, skilled football player and there is usually room for guys like that.	\N	83	5.17999999999999972	sterling-bailey	\N
2555500	Jimmy	Bean	9	77	264	9.75	It's easy to be overlooked when playing across the way from All-American defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah, but NFL scouts liked what they saw in Bean throughout the last three years. His 2013 effort (34 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks) was especially impressive coming off a redshirt season for a dislocated knee. In 2014, he again started all 13 games, racking up 42 tackles, six for loss, 3.5 sacks, and three forced fumbles. Bean was on the way to his best year as a senior, making 25 stops, 10.5 for loss, and 5.5 sacks in just the first eight games of 2015, but unfortunately, he missed the rest of the year with a torn ACL. Adding injury to the insult of being overlooked will probably hurt his draft status, but a patient team could find a real deal a year down the road.	Long, angular frame. Very reliable, rangy tackler. Has decent lateral quickness to chase perimeter runs. Bodies up and wraps up and can launch into successful finish while on the move. Allowed no broken tackles over the last three years. Uses spin move to disengage from blockers and as his inside rush move counter. Played with adequate quickness for T/E twists. Finished with 5.5 sacks in 2015.	Lacks the twitch and get ­off to climb the edge as pass rusher. Showed no consistent transition of speed-to­-power from the edge. Below average awareness. Eyes don't see beyond line of scrimmage and failed to see play development quickly enough. Gave in too easily against smaller blockers. Tries to take on with lead shoulder rather than powerful hand usage. Lacking pass rush plan and consistent play speed.	\N	Looks the part on the hoof, but tape is a much different story. Bean is unable to count on edge speed or power as a traits-­based pass rush attack and his hands are simply not skilled enough. He is an average athlete lacking plus power at the point of attack so his call might not come until very late or after the draft.	\N	18	4.76999999999999957	jimmy-bean	\N
2555502	Adam	Gotsis	10	76	287	10.75	Though he spent more time playing Australian Rules football than American football growing up in Melbourne, Gotsis was a quick learner. He starred for a local club team before heading to Atlanta, and then played well as a true freshman against ACC competition. The 2014 consensus second-team all-conference pick is still raw, and played out of position as an interior lineman for Tech's defense considering his lack of bulk. He garnered 2015 third-team All-ACC accolades with 31 tackles, five for loss, and three sacks in nine games, but saw his season cut short with a November knee injury suffered against Virginia.	Broad­-shouldered, sturdy frame with long arms and big hands. Plays with power at point of attack despite lack of desired weight for interior. Comes off snap with decent pad level. Powerful base and can anchor up against double teams and fight through redirect blocks. Team captain. Can run with athletic gait. Heavy tackler using blunt force and an aggressive finish.	Average processing to read and react. Has little juice as a pass rusher and was unable to generate consistent pocket pressure during his time at Georgia Tech. Suffered season­-ending knee injury on Oct. 31. Square-­framed two-­gapper lacking the quickness to win in gaps and make plays on other side of the line.	Jeff Zgonina	Three-year starter and team captain who came over from Australia and became an immediate factor for the Georgia Tech defense. Gotsis is strong and gritty and may have some value in both 3­-4 and 4­-3 fronts. Gotsis is on schedule to play next season provided his medicals check out at the combine. As a two-­down player likely to come out on passing downs, there is a ceiling on his draft value, but he should be a solid back­up with eventual starter potential.	"Tough player. He's limited. Won't be a pass rusher, but he's hard to move. He has value as a run-­stopper but probably late-round since he has the knee." -- AFC East scout	4	5.5	adam-gotsis	\N
2555503	Joel	Heath	10	77	293	10.5	Heath was seeing very little playing time with the Spartans despite a sparkling high school resume in Ohio, so it was decided he needed to move positions to have more of an impact. After playing 15 games in his first two years on the team, recording no tackles, Heath added 30 pounds to move from defensive end to defensive tackle. The growth resulted in a lean but strong interior frame which led to a starting role in 12 of 13 games played in 2014 (29 tackles, four for loss, 3.5 sacks). Heath set career highs in his second year as a starter last fall, collecting 31 stops, 5.5 for losses (including two sacks) and being named honorable mention All-Big Ten by league media. Heath already has plans for life after football, as he's marrying his girlfriend in the spring, with star defensive end Shilique Calhoun given best man duties.	Worker bee who keeps grinding until the whistle blows. Plays with the motor and strength to find out single blocks and maintains quality pad level against double teams. Fights through engagement and will give chase down the line after ball carrier. Recently married. Highly devout leader on defensive line. Tall defender with potential to play in odd and even fronts.	Very average body control. Has issues maintaining his base against down blocks and core strength appears just average. Converted from defensive end and play strength isn't quite there yet. Doesn't generate the pocket push or overall pressure to play on third downs. More consumed with blocker in front of him and will miss runner darting through his gap.	\N	Fifth-year senior considered one of the good guys on the team. Heath's transition from outside down to defensive tackle didn?t net much production, but Heath has intriguing size that could appeal to defenses running multiple fronts. Heath's lack of pass rush or dominant run stopping tape could hurt his cause on draft weekend.	\N	34	5.11000000000000032	joel-heath	\N
2555504	Branden	Jackson	9	76	273	10.25	Jackson absolutely looks the part of an NFL defensive end/rush linebacker, but like many Tech defenders, was underrated due to Tech's middling success and the program's reputation for offensive prowess. As a redshirt freshman, he played in all 13 games as a reserve (19 tackles, one forced fumble) and then gave a glimpse of his talent while starting every game in 2013 (44 tackles, nine for loss, four sacks). Jackson started 12 games as a junior, producing well (44 stops, 10.5 for loss, five sacks) but failing to receive All-Big 12 recognition for his efforts. His numbers dropped off a bit in 2015 (31 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks), but his potential made him an easy invite to the 2016 NFL Scouting Combine.	Long legs with frame to continue adding muscle. Has good length with big hands. Former linebacker who has maintained his athleticism despite added weight during time at Tech. Pretty good upfield get­-off as pass rusher from the edge. Flashes some penetration traits. Has additional closing gear when he has quarterback in his sights. Able to battle for the edge against much bigger opponents.	Tweener lacking bulk inside and juice of an edge player. Doesn?t generate enough natural power to displace blockers. Gets into protracted battles with tight ends rather than manhandling them. Coasts on too many plays. Needs greater sense of urgency from play to play. Gets near the ball, but doesn't convert. Lack of desired balance and body control lead to missed tackles. Lacks consistent pass rush ability.	\N	Good athlete with quality movement skills who doesn't make nearly enough plays against the run or as a pass rusher. His best bet is to pack more muscle on as a strong­side defensive end who can offer backup potential.	"He'll have a flash here and there, but not enough to warrant drafting him." -- AFC area scout	21	4.87000000000000011	branden-jackson	\N
2555505	Matt	Judon	9	75	275	9.5	This Michigan native earned just about every honor he could for his play in 2015. He won the Gene Upshaw Trophy as Division II's top lineman and was named the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference's (GLIAC) Defensive Lineman of the Year and Associated Press Little All-American squad. He led all of college football with 20 sacks among his 23.5 tackles for loss, made 81 total tackles and forced three fumbles. Judon showed promise beating D2 tackles off the edge with length and speed as a junior, as well, winning first team All-GLIAC honors with 19 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks, and four forced fumbles. All of this success came after losing four games in the middle of the 2012 season (seven TFL, 3.5 sacks) and all but the first seven plays of the 2013 season with injuries.	Massive production after pulverizing his competition this year. Finished with 20 sacks, 23.5 tackles for loss, three forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. Chiseled body with natural power baked into his compact frame and exceptionally long arms. Was too powerful for many of the tackles he faced. Rushes passer with a plan. Uses rip moves around the edge and ties an inside counter with it. Keeps track to the quarterback tight along the arc. Has inside club move to clear up space.	Square shouldered rusher who can be run up and around the quarterback by tackles with decent feet and strength. Will miss out on some finishes due to some lower body stiffness. Cruises along without making proper use of hands. Level of competition along offensive line is substantially lower than what he will see in pros. Tore an ACL two years ago and missed East-West Shrine Game invitation due to "tweaked meniscus."	Ryan Delaire	Small-school wonder with monster production over the last two seasons despite an admitted stretch of "timidness" after returning from an ACL tear that robbed him off his 2013 season. Judon has an NFL frame and rushes the quarterback with a plan, but he is still very raw from a technical standpoint and is still a project at this juncture. Judon has enough talent to warrant a draft pick, but will need time to find his way as a pro.	\N	225	5.29000000000000004	matt-judon	\N
2555506	Ufomba	Kamalu	9	77	295	\N	Kamalu came to the United States as a freshman in high school without a mastery of the English language, so he lacked real recruiting hype because of his issues trying to succeed academically. Once given the opportunity to play at Butler Community College in 2012, however, he proved athletic and strong enough (54 tackles, 7.5 sacks, three forced fumbles) to get a chance at major college football. Kamalu saw the field a fair amount in his first two years in Coral Gables, playing nine games in 2013 (13 tackles, 3.5 sacks) and then starting two of 13 games played as a junior (34 stops, 3.5 sacks). Miami coaches stuck him in the starting lineup nine times in 2015, watching him rack up 47 tackles, four for loss, and one interception.	Tall with wide hips and a frame to carry more mass. Played all along the defensive line and can fit in even or odd fronts. Plays with some bend at the point of attack striking an upward blow. Notable arm length and consistent arm extension allows him to control his turf as 2-­gapper and shed when ready. Flashes a physical demeanor. Has strength and toughness to constrict rushing lanes and create congestion. Had a solid week of practice at the NFLPA game.	Slow twitch defender. Devoid of initial explosion off the snap and into the neutral zone. Might not have the traits to ever be a disruptive player. When playing laterally, pad level rises creating contact balance trouble. Lacks pursuit quickness and has limited range of effectiveness against the run. Uninspired as pass rusher. Unable to attack the edge as pass rusher and generates nominal pocket push as bull rusher.	Rodney Gunter	The lack of pass rush will automatically restrict his draft stock, but teams are always intrigued by players with traits and Kamalu's height, weight and length meet NFL standards. Kamalu lacks range and disruptive ability, but he's got power at the point of attack and understands how to utilize his arm length as a 2­-gap defender. The 3­-4 defenses looking for depth and help against the run could target Kamalu at some point on Day 3.	\N	23	5.20999999999999996	ufomba-kamalu	\N
2555507	Darius	Latham	10	76	311	\N	Latham is a product of Indianapolis' North Central High School, where he starred as a football and basketball player, and decided to sign on with his home state team despite being a top 20 defensive tackle recruit nationally. The team made room for their prized recruit on the field immediately, as he played in all 12 games as a regular in the rotation (22 tackles, three for loss, two sacks, three pass break-ups). Latham made some plays in his sophomore year (10 starts, 26 tackles, 5.5 for loss, 1.5 sacks) but turned up his game a bit in his junior year. He garnered honorable mention All-Big Ten honors after making 33 tackles, 10 for loss, and four sacks during 2015. However, NFL scouts evaluating the early entrant will take heed that Latham was twice suspended for one game due to violating team rules.	Sports broad shoulders and and NFL mass. Specializes in hand to hand combat at the point of attack. Uses his jarring upper body power to dislodge blockers from their spot on his way to the ball. Uses size and strength to create gap disruption. Hands are quick and violent using them to club, slap and shove to keep linemen off of him. Raw, but has some rush to him. Has feet to get to the guard?s edge as a pass rusher and can generate instant pocket push against anchor-deficient blockers.	Plays hard but lacks proper conditioning. Might not have enough power in his lowers to sit down and own both gaps. Will go along with wash down blocks rather than battling through it. Body control needs to improve. Consistency at the point of attack can improve with better bend. Personal character has scouts concerned. Was suspended twice for "undisclosed violations" forcing him to miss three games. Flagged eight times for 90 yards including three 15­-yard penalties.	Quinton Dial	Broad shouldered interior defender who can fit in 4­-3 or 3­-4 fronts. Latham uses his hands and length to unlock his impressive upper body strength, but he is more of a "flash" prospect than consistent performer. While his run stopping is inconsistent at times, it appears to be correctable with more work. Latham's size and play traits might get him drafted beyond his production if his work ethic and character check out.	"He's got a projectable frame that can add more weight and muscle. I look at his power and his ability to create disturbance in the pocket and that is what he will get drafted on. The so-called 'cons' is what we get coached to improve." -- NFL assistant defensive line coach	31	5.48000000000000043	darius-latham	\N
2555508	Nile	Lawrence-Stample	10	73	320	9.875	Lawrence-Stample is a run-stuffer, pure and simple. The nose tackle eats double teams for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If single-blocked, however, Lawrence-Stample can find the ball and has the short-area quickness to make the play, so NFL teams looking for a pure nose tackle could be interested. A pectoral injury limited him to four games in 2014, although he came back for the team's Rose Bowl appearance against Oregon (blocking an extra point). A healthy 2015 season, where he played in all 13 games and earned first-team All-ACC honors (36 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks), gave NFL scouts something to consider when reviewing interior defenders.	Stubby, but stout lower body. Decent lateral movement and is a willing chaser down the line. Has quickness off the snap to attack a gap and stress the edge. Better as aggressive upfield player than read-­and-­react two­-gapper. Very good vision into backfield and keeps running back locked in.	Phone booth worker with limited play range. Inconsistent get-off after snap. Would like to see him become more aggressive with his punch and control technique when two-gapping. Average body control. Not much of a pass rusher.	Zach Kerr	While he has the thickness of a plugging nose tackle, Lawrence­-Stample didn't control his grass and dominate at the point of attack as much as scouts wanted to see this season. He has enough power in his base to anchor against double teams and his work at the point of attack will improve with more hand work. Appears to be a backup interior lineman who can handle rotational work.	\N	3	5.20000000000000018	nile-lawrence-stample	\N
2555509	Chris	Mayes	10	75	338	\N	Mayes didn't play football until his junior year of high school, but it didn't take long for recruiters to see that growing frame and recognize his potential. He committed to Georgia, but started his collegiate career at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, playing one season (17 tackles) and redshirting the next to get his academic house in order. Mayes made it to Georgia for the 2013 season and stepped into a regular role (eight starts, 31 tackles, sack, two pass breakups). He was limited to a backup role as a junior, however, playing in just eight games and making seven tackles (one for loss). Mayes found his groove in 2015, becoming the full-time starting nose guard and making 41 stops (one for loss) while eating space inside.	Wide frame with body that could handle a little more mass if needed. Shows some ability to unhinge from blocks and make tackles. Runners rarely escape from his clutches once he gets into them allowing just one broken tackle and no missed tackles. Able to beat a single block with upper body strength.	Very average athlete. Inconsistent contact balance when forced to move. Doesn't play with anchor expected from a nose. Can be moved by double teams and quality down-­blocks. Gets too caught up with the fight in front of him rather than finding the ball. No threat as pass rusher with just one career sack. Will be a 25-year-old rookie in September.	\N	Nose tackle with a big frame but lacking the power and anchor needed for the position. Pad level can be his primary nemesis so if he can get that straightened out, he might have an outside shot.	\N	83	4.94000000000000039	chris-mayes	\N
2555510	Alex	McCalister	9	78	239	9.375	McCalister's career did not go as he planned as a four-star recruit and all-state pick from North Carolina. He redshirted his first year with the Gators, earning Defensive Scout Player of the Week multiple times during the season. In 2013, he made only three tackles in six games due to injury. When finally given a chance to get into the defensive line rotation as a sophomore, McCalister finished second on the team with six sacks among his nine tackles for loss (2.5 against LSU). He tied for the team lead with 6.5 sacks in 2015, even though he only played in nine games due to injury, missing the final three regular season contests with a foot injury and earning his second suspension of the year before the bowl game for violating team rules. McCalister was actually dismissed from the team at the end of the year, causing him to declare himself an early entrant for the 2016 NFL Draft.	Looks like a bigger version of Leonard Floyd. Has rare length and range to defend both the quarterback and running back against zone read. Ridiculous ground coverage over first three steps. Able to drop, dip and accelerate around the edge like it's an embankment. Features upfield burst and springy hips that are waiting to be unlocked and unleashed. Will flash a "whoa!" spin move that he's still learning to harness. Shows ability to long-­arm tackles back into the pocket.	Was dismissed from the team late in the year. Rushes with no discernible plan or workable counter moves. Can't hold his water versus the run. Instincts are lacking. Doesn't use long levers as effectively as he could. Frame nowhere near thick enough. Has to work overtime to try and keep weight on. Suffered a foot injury in November of this season.	Obum Gwacham	Despite playing in less than 40 percent of the defensive snaps for the Gators over the past two seasons, managed to notch 12.5 sacks. His character must be questioned and he doesn't possess an NFL-­ready frame or instincts. McCalister is a project in need of muscle and coaching, but his traits as a rusher are exciting if he can build upon them.	\N	82	5.32000000000000028	alex-mccalister	\N
2555511	Giorgio	Newberry	9	77	285	9.5	When a recruit signs to play defensive end at Florida State, they'd better know that the competition for playing time will be tough. Even though Newberry was a four-star recruit, he found this lesson out the hard way. He struggled to get on the field in his redshirt freshman (13 tackles), sophomore, and junior seasons (two stops), even switching over to a blocking tight end spot during the 2013 season. His only start in a Seminole uniform came in a two-tight end set. Newberry served as the up-back on punt coverage teams, as well, during his career. Under new defensive end coach Brad Lawing, Newberry revitalized his game, making 21 stops, three for loss and two sacks as a more regular part of the defensive line rotation and earning an invite to the NFL Scouting Combine.	Long and angular build with more room for mass if he hits the weights. Active hands in the passing lane. Credited with six passes defensed this season. Has foot quickness to potentially threaten in twists game. Raw, but moldable.	Doesn't have a position. Was moved from defensive end to tackle to tight end back to tackle. Not enough juice to rush from edge and not enough strength play inside. High cut with thick legs. Work ethic has been an issue in the past. Has very limited playing time over his career and little production.	\N	Projection-­based player only. Used as a sub­-package rusher at Florida State, but didn?t generate the pressures or sack totals expected from a "specialist". Looks stiff on tape, but if he tests well at combine, could get some attention thanks to size.	\N	3	4.84999999999999964	giorgio-newberry	\N
2555516	Ron	Thompson	9	75	253	9.375	It is possible Thompson would have entered the 2016 NFL Draft even if Orange head coach Scott Shafer was kept on. Since Dino Babers was hired, Thompson decided there would be too much change involved, so he decided to move on to the next level. Former Orange defensive end Chandler Jones blazed a trail for Thompson four years ago, leaving school a year early and winding up a first-round pick. Thompson might not garner that sort of grade, but he did well enough in his final collegiate season to pique the interest of scouts. He received third-team All-ACC honors from league coaches with 35 tackles, 9.5 for loss, seven sacks, and four forced fumbles. Thompson showed promise as a pass rusher in 2013 (20 tackles, 4.5 for loss, two sacks) and 2014, when he started all 12 games and making 32 tackles, seven for loss, and three sacks.	Former high school tight end and basketball player with fluid footwork. Has lateral quickness and closing burst to to chase and finish. Can dial up dangerous inside spin move from either end spot as rusher. Rushes with forward lean creating momentum towards quarterback when he defeats blocker?s punch. Aware and intelligent. Recognizes play progression. Knee-­bender who can sink and spring laterally into tackles. Forced six fumbles over last two seasons. Can drop easily into space and squeezes coverage responsibilities. Scheme flexible as end or outside backer. Looks to get hands into passing lane.	Despite athleticism, tackle production lower than expected. Needs to become better finisher as tackler. Half-strider with average edge speed and burst. Will rely heavily on hands as a rusher over speed and length. Can be a step late to close down backside cutback lanes. Needs to incorporate more violent, physical hand usage to go with his finesse hand work. Could use more aggression to set hard edge against run.	Lorenzo Mauldin	Thompson played inside as an undersized tackle in 2014, but was moved to his natural defensive end spot this year. The more tape you get through, the easier it becomes to see his NFL fit. Thompson might be slotted as a defensive end, but I see him as an instinctive 3-­4 edge rusher who can put a hand in the ground in sub packages. Thompson could benefit by leaning down to improve his overall quickness as a rusher.	\N	26	5.25	ron-thompson	\N
2555512	Drew	Ott	9	76	273	9.625	The former Nebraska Gatorade High School Player of the Year and Parade All-American was a productive strong-side end for the Hawkeyes who garnered second-team All-Big Ten honors from the media in 2014 after leading his team in tackles for loss (12) and sacks (7.5). He had showed promise in his sophomore season, as well, starting 12 games and making 50 tackles (6.5 for loss, 2.5 sacks) His senior year, however, did not go according to plan as two injuries (dislocated left elbow, torn right ACL) limited him to six games (though he had 7.5 tackles for loss and five sacks in that limited time). Ott enjoys eating raw eggs, shell and all. He applied for a medical redshirt, but the decision was not yet determined before receiving his scouting combine invitation.	Motor never turns off and creates wins for him. Shows desired awareness and play recognition for the position. Knee bender who rarely sees his pad level rise above that of his competition. Plays from consistent leveraged position. Has enough size and toughness to set an acceptable edge. Hand work is a plus against the run. Forced three fumbles with limited playing time due to injury.	Has below average lateral agility and overall range. Doesn't have the quickness to consistently avoid reach blocks from athletic tackles. Missing juice upfield to threaten the edge. Try hard pass rusher, but lacking NFL skills and talent. Can get initial push from his bull rush, but it dies there. Tore ACL midseason.	\N	High-effort worker, but NFL production could be limited by his lack of athleticism. Ott is a rotational base end who could find work as a backup, but that might mean Ott's draft stock could be in some trouble.	\N	32	5.13999999999999968	drew-ott	\N
2555513	D.J.	Pettway	9	74	265	9.5	Pettway's collegiate journey has been rocky, but in the end he survived his own mistakes to become part of a national champion. A four-star recruit, Pettway redshirted his first season in Tuscaloosa and earned Freshman All-SEC notice from league coaches in 2013 after contributing in 13 games as a reserve (eight tackles, four for loss, 2.5 sacks). In February of 2013, things turned for the worse after he was charged with second degree robbery, being one of four players to attack two students to use their credit cards to buy food. The charges against Pettway were eventually dropped, and after a season at East Mississippi Community College (where he had 18.5 tackles for loss, 11.5 sacks, and won a national title), he was allowed to return. He received the only start of his Alabama career in 2014, but played a fair amount in the rotation (23 tackles, three for loss, two sacks). Pettway contributed again in the Tide's championship season last fall, making 18 stops, five for loss and two sacks in 15 games played.	Attacks opponent across from him like a sled drill with low pad level and an upward striking blow. Able to convert speed to power and crank up a bull ­rush with a leveraged, jarring punch. Plays with good awareness and reads play­-action and zone reads quickly. Shows good lateral scoot to close down the line. Has power in his hands to punch and control the edge. Able to help squeeze running lanes and force runners to spill it wide.	Lacks desired height as defensive end and arm length falls below the drafted norm. Power offset by lack of athleticism. Edge presence missing from his pass rush. Scouts concerned about his natural fit as on the field. Caught up in exceptionally deep defensive line rotation and failed build resume built on production. Character must be vetted.	\N	Powerful base end with a shot to play standing linebacker for a team looking for toughness and an edge-setter. While Pettway's college production is hardly impressive, it was partially because of his lack of snaps due to Alabama?s rotations. Pettway isn't a premium rusher, but he has NFL toughness and power at the point of attack. Pettway could offer depth as a base end or may be able to add weight over time and transition inside.	\N	88	5.04999999999999982	d.j.-pettway	\N
2555514	Hassan	Ridgeway	10	75	303	9.375	Ridgeway moved from California to Texas when he was 14 and, given the fervor that the Lone Star State tackle has for the gridiron, he found himself suiting up for Friday Night Lights not playing up to that point in his life. It didn't take long for his athleticism to shine, as he earned all-state honors and became a coveted recruit who stayed in-state. Ridgeway redshirted in 2012, then played 12 games as a reserve the following year (13 tackles, one for loss). He started getting after it as a sophomore, starting the final 10 games, making 43 stops and ranking among the team leaders in tackles for loss (11) and sacks (six). Ridgeway lost some time to injuries last fall, starting eight of the 11 games in which he played. He still received honorable mention All-Big 12 notice, however, with 36 tackles, 6.5 for loss, and 3.5 sacks.	Dense, powerful lower half combined with burly upper body. Snap experience at multiple spots along the line. Explodes out of stance and into his downhill charge. Striking athletic ability for a big. Has some change of direction twitch. Sets hard edge with good punch and arm extension to deny blocker's intentions. Grows roots against double teams and fights hard for his spot. Defeats most single blocks. Has play power to step through a blocker's edges with little trouble. Plays with good recognition and quick discard capability to snap down on tackle opportunities. Talented interior pass rusher. Uses coordinated attack with violent active hands and nimble feet. Flashes power to push and quickness to disrupt.	Conditioning has been an issue in the past. Plays hard, but gasses so may need plenty of rotational help. Despite athleticism, range as playmaker is a little limited. Will momentarily lose track of the ball when trying to impose his will on blocker in front of him. Stops flowing outside with play when looking back inside looking to make a play. Hounded by nagging injuries for much of the year. Was hindered by a back issue that arose before the season and then a shoulder injury later. Production didn?t always match the talent on the tape.	Kawaan Short	Ridgeway didn't put together as productive and flashy a junior campaign as he did a sophomore season, but that was due partially to nagging injuries. You can watch snap after snap and clear losses to the blocker are hard to find. Ridgeway has a rare combination of power and athleticism that give him the potential to impact the game on all three downs. His talent could make him the most impactful defensive tackle to come out of this draft, but his floor is lower than some due to concerns over health and conditioning.	"He's more talented than Malcolm Brown was coming out but his conditioning and injuries worry you. With time and money will his weight balloon? Will he be motivated to work in the offseason? He would have benefited by going back to school." -- NFL general manager	19	6.16999999999999993	hassan-ridgeway	\N
2555515	DeVaunte	Sigler	10	75	298	9.875	Sigler's dismissal from Auburn for violating team rules after his sophomore year could have been the end of his career, especially since he didn't play at all in 2013. He worked as a brick mason that year, vowing to make things right for his young daughter. Sigler made the most of his second chance, getting his grades in order and tearing up the Ohio Valley Conference as the league's Defensive Player of the Year in 2014. He also earned second-team FCS All-American honors from the Associated Press after accumulating 36 tackles, nine for loss, 3.5 sacks, an interception and two forced fumbles. Sigler had a setback in his final year on campus, as injuries robbed him of multiple games. Yet, he still was named second-team All-Ohio Valley Conference by making 32 tackles, 2.5 for loss, two sacks and four pass breakups in ten games.	Good feel for double teams. Will widen base and drop his anchor when facing the double. Aggressive twister as pass rusher. Looks to cave in blocker when he's the first man in on a twist. Has good upfield burst as pass rusher and plays with a good motor pursuing plays up and down the field until he hears the whistle.	Had some issues dealing with the power of Auburn's Shon Coleman in the run game. Must work to stay lower rather than give blockers access under his pads. Must learn to play with his hands earlier in the rep. Gets dislodged before he looks to shed rather than punching and controlling. Pass rush consists of just bull rushes. Missed a good portion of 2015 with injuries. Dismissed from Auburn for undisclosed violations.	\N	Sigler has the size, motor and functional play strength to get him into a camp, but he will need to become much better with his hands and do more as a pass rusher to become more than just a camp body. Sigler will need to answer questions about his character and medicals at the combine as well.	\N	248	4.96999999999999975	devaunte-sigler	\N
2555517	Vincent	Valentine	10	76	329	9.625	Valentine's career showed real promise at times, yet was marked by inconsistency and injury. He played in all 13 games as a redshirt freshman in 2013, getting a starting call six times (the first four, and the final two) in order to make 21 tackles, five for loss and a sack. In the Illinois high school all-state pick?s sophomore season, it looked like the consistency was coming as he started 11 times, recording 45 stops, seven for loss, and three sacks in the middle. A knee injury slowed him down during his fourth and final year on campus, limiting him to seven starts, 10 tackles, four for loss, and three sacks. Instead of returning to school to prove himself to scouts, Valentine chose to leave early for the NFL with his diploma in hand.	Burly calves and and thick legs that look like sacks of grain. Proper study requires viewing of 2014 tape when he was healthy. Can sit down and live in his space. Has power to thrash undersized centers right out of the picture. Able to eat up double teams and road­block his run fit when he's on his game. Reactive quickness to turn and snap onto running backs attempting to dart past him. Finished with more career sacks than teammate Maliek Collins.	Carries excessive weight in the middle and lacks desired lean muscle mass for his frame. Could get more from his power with proper hand usage. Scouts question effort level in 2015. Slammed by insiders for a lack of conditioning and practice habits. Missed extensive time due to high ankle sprain.	Darius Kilgo	His draft grade will likely be higher than his 2015 tape would indicate due to a high ankle sprain that limited his overall play and production. Valentine needs to carry more "good weight" and commit to the work that has to be done leading up to the game. If he can do those things, he has enough power and ability to become a backup nose with eventual starter potential.	\N	16	5.21999999999999975	vincent-valentine	\N
2555518	Antwaun	Woods	10	72	318	9.625	Googling the phrase "low center of gravity" should bring up a picture of Woods. It took him three years to become a full-time starter for the Trojans, redshirting in 2011 and going in and out of the lineup as a freshman (four starts, 16 tackles, 4.5 for loss, three sacks) and sophomore (six starts, 19 tackles, two for loss, one sack). Woods earned a larger role in 2014, starting 10 times and making 37 tackles and a sack, but he missed the Holiday Bowl after tearing a pectoral muscle during practice. Things finally came together for Woods in his first-team All-Conference senior season (41 stops, seven for loss, three sacks), giving scouts enough tape to see he could be the "immovable object" to halt the "unstoppable forces" known as NFL running backs.	Feet are never at rest and constantly working to find optimal positioning. Good motor and willing worker through the whistle. Hustles hard. Played at more impactful level against the run this year over last. Surprising foot quickness and short area aptitude. Pursues hard down the line against the run. Has power in his hands and uses heavy club move as pass rusher.	Squatty with a thick midsection and short limbs. Offensive linemen with length give him issues. Plays upright and his lack of leverage could lead to issues against NFL power and double teams. Will drop head and lose track of where blocks are coming from. Needs to add an element of penetration to his game. Not a natural pocket pusher.	\N	Burly from his knees to his neck, Woods was a rock-­steady contributor for the Trojans this year after injuries and inconsistency hampered him in the past. With that said, he lacks the size and run­-stuffing element teams look for from nose tackles. Woods had a good week of practice at the NFLPA game, but will need to find a high­-end play trait he can lean on as a pro.	\N	50	5	antwaun-woods	\N
2555519	Dominique	Alexander	12	72	232	\N	Football is a family affair for the Alexanders. His father, Derrick, Sr., played at Oklahoma State and his brother, Derrick, Jr., is also heading toward an NFL career after excelling as a defensive lineman at Tulsa. Alexander's natural football acumen shone through in his first year with the Sooners, winning the Big 12 Defensive Freshman of the Year by starting the final eight games, making 80 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and forcing two fumbles. He started all 13 games each of the next two seasons, earning second-team All-Big 12 honors from the Associated Press in 2014 (107 tackles, six for loss, 1.5 sacks) and first-team all-conference accolades from coaches as a junior (103 tackles, seven for loss, 1.5 sacks). Even though he could have stayed at Oklahoma one more season, he decided to join his brother on the road to the next level.	Has speed to chase and corral. Able to close out stray running backs and bootleg­-action quarterbacks. Lateral quickness and agility to scrape from gap to gap ahead of climbing linemen on off-­tackle plays. Open field change of direction opens door to make more plays. Undersized but willing to sacrifice his body by chopping down short­-pulling guards to stack the hole. Downhill tackler looking to stop it before it gets started. Made 32 percent of his tackles this season for gains of two yards or less. Smooth drops into space with natural man-­cover talent.	Needs work in the weight room to add needed mass. Very little "take­-on" ability and can be blasted out of the hole. Sticks to blocks. Might not possess the strength or instincts to play inside in a 4­-3. Frequently over­-pursues causing him to void his run fits. Needs improved inside-­out approach in pursuit of ball carriers. Tackle consistency can improve with bulk and a "body up" attack. Can be fooled completely out of a play by play­ fakes.	Brandon Marshall	Small, but rangy linebacker with very good play speed but a lack of desired strength. It's easy to want to write Alexander off considering his issues with play strength, but then you look at his downhill tackling and ability to get to the ball and you reassess. Alexander's ability to cover in space should pair well with a move to outside linebacker in a 4-­3 where he can avoid some of the size coming at him that gave him issues inside.	"Small and can't get off blocks. Not very instinctive either. He'll get drafted earlier because he can run but I see him as a late rounder at best." -- Big 12 area scout	17	5.55999999999999961	dominique-alexander	\N
2555520	Beniquez	Brown	13	73	229	9.125	Instead of playing for a third linebackers coach in five seasons, Brown followed the lead of former teammate and 2015 second-round pick Bernardrick McKinney to enter the NFL draft after his junior season. Brown didn't garner the accolades that McKinney did during his career with the Bulldogs, failing to make a coaches or media all-conference squad over the past three years. However, there is little question of his football acumen. He started the final three games of his redshirt freshman season, recording 39 tackles, 4.5 for loss in 13 games. Brown made plays as a starting outside linebacker in 2014, ranking second on the team with 62 tackles, seven for loss, and two interceptions. In 2015, NFL scouts started really noticing Brown's play on the outside as he racked up 99 tackles and blocked two kicks, including a potential game-winner by Arkansas in the game's final seconds. He ended his career on a sharp note, making nine stops, two for loss, against North Carolina State in the Belk Bowl.	Posted productive junior season in talent­-rich SEC. Likes the game played downhill. Wrap-­up tackler who finished with 100 total tackles and four sacks this season. Big enough to play through an angle block and work back into a play. Lively in his pursuit to the sideline and racks up tackles as mop­-up man on the perimeter. Communicative on the field helping to direct traffic.	Marginal athlete lacking burst to the ball. Step slow to read and flow allowing climbing linemen to force him over the top of the block. Very average body control and balance through contact. Will occasionally side­step a block rather than taking it on with a shoulder and leveraging his gap. Instincts for run fits is sub-par. Needs better feel for seal blocks headed his way and must improve his hand usage.	Amarlo Herrera	Tape doesn't always match ­up with the production numbers ­ especially against high-­end competition like Alabama and LSU. Brown's an able tackler and will flow into gaps looking for impact plays, but his average recognition time paired with marginal lateral quickness prevents him from consistently beating climbing blockers to the spot. Brown has some eventual starter ability but lacks the play traits teams covet from inside.	\N	92	5.23000000000000043	beniquez-brown	\N
2555521	Steven	Daniels	12	71	243	\N	If any running back has a question about Daniels' size, he'll be happy to answer you with a big shot to the mouth. No matter what his official height might be, the three-year starter for the Eagles is a big-time thumper in the middle. He stepped into the linebacker rotation as a freshman (25 tackles, one start at Will) and then moved onto the first team listing as a sophomore (88 tackles, 6.5 for loss, three sacks, three pass breakups). Daniels had 72 tackles, 1.5 for loss, as a junior before taking his game to another level in 2015. The first-team All-ACC selection led B.C. with 82 stops, 16 for loss, and six sacks as the Eagles ranked first in the FBS in total defense.	Vending machine build with wide hips and burly frame made for life inside. Downhill daddy. Anticipates his run fits and will jump downhill into the gaps to congest the lane. Has terrific upper body strength and some nasty in his big hands. Able to snatch and shed blockers with force. Can sense down blocks and sinks to fend them off. Instinctive, intelligent approach to the game.	Stiff­-legged puncher when taking on climbing linemen and will give some initial ground due to a lack of bend. Below average athleticism and balance create slim margin of error as a tackler. Has some downhill burst to the ball, but has borderline range and coverage ability as a pro.	Jeff Luc	On first glance, Daniels simply appears to be too big and stiff to be able to function as an NFL linebacker, but the more you watch, the more you realize that his motor and strength makes up for some of his deficiencies. Daniels has flexibility limitations that will hurt him, but his production over the last three years as a downhill player should be considered. He plays better football than he tests and could become a consideration for 3­-4 teams looking for a thumper to add some depth.	\N	22	5.11000000000000032	steven-daniels	\N
2555522	B.J.	Goodson	13	73	242	\N	Like many players on major college football powers, Goodson rose up the ranks during his career, waiting for others to graduate or move on to the NFL before being able to show off his full skill set. He was no slouch coming from the same high school as former Clemson and NFL standout linebacker Levon Kirkland, though Goodson's game is not similar to that of his boyhood hero. After two years as a reserve (11 tackles in 2012-2013), Goodson became a co-starter at linebacker as a redshirt sophomore, making 34 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and three recovered fumbles. He took the reins of the defense in his senior season, leading the Tigers with 108 tackles, 14 of which resulted in losses including 5.5 sacks. Goodson displayed an excellent all-around game, intercepting two passes, breaking up three others, and forcing a fumble during the year to garner third-team All-ACC honors from league coaches (second-team from league media).	Team captain and leader on that side of the ball. Surprising production as a one-year starter. Stocky with a muscular build to withstand the rigors inside. Brings a thumper's mentality to the field. Uses potent punch-and-shed technique full of leverage and power to attack second level blockers. Took it to Notre Dame?s Nick Martin. Willing to sacrifice body to disrupt blocking and play flow. Plays with base and balance and able to slide under blocks to work into tackles. Has play strength to challenge turn-out blocks and leverage his gap. Rarely cheated as a tackler.	Hip stiffness leads to athletic limitations in space. Lumbering pursuit speed to the perimeter. Allows running backs a fair shot at turning the corner when he's chasing. Little margin for error with angles to the ball. Still learning patience in his flow to prevent cutback lanes. Labored backpedal in space. Grabby in coverage and could be in trouble when matched up in space. Play-action can cause him to lose his bearings.	Max Bullough	Physical, two-day linebacker with the desire to scrape downhill and strike what he sees. Goodson's lack of pursuit speed and overall athleticism could be troubling to teams, but his toughness and consistency of effort will appeal to teams who value force in the middle. Goodson could figure on the third day of the draft as a backup with eventual starter potential.	\N	1	5.41999999999999993	b.j.-goodson	\N
2555523	C.J.	Johnson	12	73	234	8.875	It's not often that a college team asks a three-year starter at defensive end to move to the middle linebacker spot. But Ole Miss coaches did just that in the spring of 2015, asking Johnson to return to his primary high school position as the master of the defense after owning the edge throughout his career. He started nine games inside as a senior (43 tackles, two for loss, two interceptions), missing a month to a torn left meniscus. Johnson had always been a bit light in the shorts to play defensive end, but he still came out blasting there as a true freshman in 2011 (three starts, 32 tackles, four for loss, one sack). He led the Rebels with 6.5 sacks (among 55 tackles, eight TFL) as a starter his sophomore year, and looked like he was on the way to another great year (12 tackles, four for loss in four games) until an ankle surgery put him on the shelf. Gaining a redshirt season, Johnson was named a captain for his junior year in 2014 (38 tackles, eight TFL, four sacks) for the nation's top scoring defense.	Accelerates past climbers and can win a race to the edge. Tremendous length to cast levers into a tackle and reel it in. Desired speed for sideline-to-sideline activity. Showed rush potential as sophomore racking up 6.5 sacks. Has hybrid characteristics. Able to slip blocks here and there with angular frame. Instinctive and aware against the pass with three interceptions over the last two seasons. Beloved by coaching staff for attitude and work ethic. Missed just two games after meniscus surgery that was expected to sideline him 4-6 weeks.	Simply not suited to play inside based on 2015 tape. Turns pads when scraping and is too easily washed away when overrunning his fit. Too much arms and not enough chest in his tackles. Misdirection and play-action leave him scratching his head too often. Has had ankle and knee surgeries over last three seasons. Play strength needs an upgrade. Has to "battle fight" to disengage from blockers and needs a clean trip to be effective flowing to ball. Has debilitating lack of hand usage inside.	\N	While Johnson is listed as an inside linebacker at the combine, he doesn't have the strength, instincts or hand-usage to make sense at that spot -- at least not without more experience and coaching. Johnson doesn't have size and speed and a background rushing the passer that could interest a team if they can get past his medicals and believe that he hasn't lost a step.	\N	93	5.04999999999999982	c.j.-johnson	\N
2555524	Cory	Littleton	13	75	238	10.125	Littleton's career at "U-Dub" was a bit up and down, moving positions and moving in and out of the starting lineup. But as they say, it's not about how you start, but where you finish. Littleton's final year on campus saw him receive honorable mention All-Pac-12 notice as a Sam linebacker, racking up 65 stops, 11 for loss, and six sacks. He had started all 13 games at defensive end as a sophomore, contributing 62 tackles, 10 for loss and five sacks for the Huskies, but found himself playing less in his junior campaign as a part-time starter (37 tackles, 3.5 for loss, one sack). Even Littleton's first year in Seattle was a bit inconsistent, as coaches inserted him into the starting line-up against Oregon after not playing him at all in the first four games of the year. He made six tackles against the Ducks (one for loss), and finished the year with 14 stops, 1.5 for loss.	Athletic with long arms and big hands. Has decent closing speed. Sinks hips and accelerates out of his change of direction. Moderate tackle production, but reduced his broken tackles and misses from a year ago. As edge rusher, has some edge bend with flexible ankles, effective shoulder dip and cat­-quick spin move. Credited with 35 pressures and six sacks on the season. Consistent special teams performer with 19 career tackles.	Play strength dips well below NFL norm for the position. Plays upright and blockers get under his pads. Allows both tight ends and fullbacks to derail his edge-­setting attempts. Can't hold the edge and is a liability when teams run downhill at him. Shows some passivity. Needs to be more physical and use his hands to clear himself from blocks.	\N	Long-limbed, stand-up pass rusher who is built more like a wide receiver than a running back. Littleton showed some pass rush ability this season and his special teams ability may be his best attribute on the next level. However, his thin frame and poor play strength could make him a long ­shot to stick on the 53.	\N	53	4.83000000000000007	cory-littleton	\N
2555525	Curt	Maggitt	13	75	247	10.125	Maggitt (muh-JIT) chipped a bone in his hip against Oklahoma in the second game of the 2015 season (he already had three tackles for loss in two games), forcing him to sit out the remainder of the season. He could have applied to the NCAA for a sixth year of eligibility, as he lost the 2013 season to a knee injury suffered as a sophomore, but decided it was time to move on to the next chapter of his life. Maggitt, whose brother, Roosevelt, played defensive end at Iowa State, was looking forward to backing up a second-team All-SEC (media) junior campaign where he led the Volunteers with 11 sacks among his 15 tackles for loss. He also had productive freshman and sophomore campaigns, starting eight times at SAM in 2011 (56 tackles, 5.5 for loss) and nine games at MIKE in 2012 (30 tackles, five for loss) before tearing his ACL.	Coach on the field and unquestioned leader of the defense. Sky­-high football character. Loves the game. Pre­-2015 hip injury, flashed twitch and suddenness of movement. Has ground-gaining strides up the field as rusher and converts advantage into edge attack for sacks. Above average skill ­set as rusher and works his plan. Able to sink, shift and redirect into shifty ball carriers. Gets jarring arm extension into target and is quick to disengage. Works to stay clean. Undeterred passion and knows how to play the game.	Plagued by injuries that limits his sample size. Thin hips and lean lower body. Limited play range and burst. Struggles to unlock hips and sprint to the sideline. Consistent contain could become an issue. Below average cover ability in man. His game could use more patience and instincts.	\N	One of the most passionate players in this draft. Maggitt plays the game with reckless abandon which can work for and against him. The team who takes him will get a player whose motor never turns off and who will give you all he's got, but his range is below average for an outside linebacker and he may be too mechanical to post consistent production as a pass rusher. All of these points are moot if his combine medicals don?t come up roses.	\N	86	5.12000000000000011	curt-maggitt	\N
2555526	Cassanova	McKinzy	12	73	248	9.875	McKinzy took over the middle of Auburn's defense in 2014 after starting on the weak side as a sophomore -- and the move seemed to suit him just fine. The downhill player made life difficult for SEC running backs between the tackles (91 tackles, 11 for loss in 2014. He changed to the "Buck" linebacker spot as a senior, again excelling in a new place (74 tackles, 10 for loss, five sacks, 20 quarterback hurries). Unfortunately, McKinzy finished his final collegiate game on crutches as he watched his team win the Birmingham Bowl (very near his childhood home) over Memphis.	Has old school thickness and thump to play inside. Will get downhill and bring some funk behind his pads at the point of attack. Plays with excellent power and twitch in his hands. Edge­-setting potential with the strength and quickness to shed would-­be blockers. Has experience playing inside and outside. Produced effective pressure rate as pass rusher when working inside twist games. Credited with 17 quarterback knockdowns in 2015.	Poor instincts and feel for play design. Gets sealed by blocks he doesn't see coming and loses gap leverage due to his instincts over a lack of play strength. Bulky frame with some stiffness. Has missed 25 tackles over last three years. Marginal quickness in his lateral scrape and rarely stays ahead of the blockers in a race for positioning. No matchup cover talent. One of the starters benched for poor play and a lack of communication after the LSU game.	James Vaughters	Thumper in the middle who can rock ­and ­roll in collision drills but gets lost when he has to activate athleticism and instincts inside of a game. McKinzy is a tough guy who can wrap and finish when he's got a clean shot and he might have some special teams value as a pro. He might not be trust­worthy enough to leave him alone in the middle of a 4-­3, but could find a spot on the inside with a 3-­4 defense.	"I like his toughness but unless you are going to use him as a pass rusher I don't see any third-down value and his entire game revolves around the box. Just too limited." -- AFC East scout	90	5.08999999999999986	cassanova-mckinzy	\N
2555527	Montese	Overton	13	74	223	9.5	Darrell Montese Overton was the son of a former ECU basketball player (Darrell, Sr.), so it was natural for him to follow in those footsteps -- though his aggressiveness is definitely more suited for the gridiron than the hardwood. His athleticism makes him a fit in any sport, and it got him onto the field as a redshirt freshman in 2012, when he started three contests and played in five more (29 tackles, 3.5 for loss). Although Overton didn?t start as a sophomore, the opposition knew when he was on the field (50 tackles, 10 for loss, six sacks, two forced fumbles). He started every game his last two seasons with the Pirates, attacking the backfield and making plays in coverage as a junior (68 tackles, 11.5 for loss, four pass break-ups) and in his second team All-American Athletic Conference senior year (70 stops, team-leading 10 TFL and 7.5 sacks, seven pass breakups.)	Has posted tremendous athletic and weight room numbers within East Carolina's strength and conditioning program. Plays with consistent aggression and tenacity. Showed ability to match up with tight ends in space. Had seven passes defensed in 2015. Has twitch for a solid punch to keep himself clean against the run. Can swoop around the edge and attack gap plays. Gives pass rush support off edge but best ­suited as blitzer. Has special teams value on kickoff coverage where he posted 11 tackles as a sophomore.	Undersized with thick waist, hips and calves. Lacks the bone structure to carry much more weight. Sticks his nose in, but can be stonewalled against quality blocking tight ends. Size and play strength will limit ability to make plays on other side of the ball as a pro. Saw six of his 7.5 sacks come over two games. Doesn't show consistent edge attack to make a living as rusher off edge.	\N	Sack numbers look fairly impressive, but skill level as a pass rusher doesn't appear to be translatable into the pro game as a situational pass rusher. Overton's best shot could be as a hybrid nickel linebacker with cover skills who also shines on special teams.	"Seems like I see a guy like this all the time now with the way college football is played. He's not loose enough to play safety and too small and skinny to play linebacker as a pro." -- NFC South scout	57	4.91999999999999993	montese-overton	\N
2555528	Nick	Vigil	12	74	239	10.25	The Vigil brothers were trouble for Mountain West foes in 2013 and 2014, with Nick and his older brother Zach terrorizing offenses with their toughness and heady play. Zach left for the NFL after the 2014 season, and had a good rookie season for Miami despite going undrafted. Instead of waiting for two years to reunite with his sibling at the next level, Nick decided four years at USU was enough, opting to enter the 2016 NFL Draft. He certainly ended his career with the Aggies on a high note, garnering first team All-Mountain West honors with 144 tackles (ranking sixth in the FBS), 13.5 of which were for losses (three sacks). Conference coaches voted him first team as a sophomore, as well, because he made 123 tackles, 16.5 for loss and seven sacks. He also played five games at running back (41-152, three TD rushing), starting one there to make him the only player in the country that year starting on both sides of the ball. Even as a redshirt freshman, Vigil got on the field regularly, starting four of 14 games played and making 55 tackles, 8.5 for loss, and 5.5 sacks, with seven of those tackles and 1.5 of those sacks coming against Northern Illinois in the Poinsettia Bowl.	Eye­-popping production from the middle with 30 tackles for loss and 267 tackles over last two seasons according to the school. High school running back with above average vision and feel for track of the run. Quick to diagnose and respond to play direction. Uses instincts to help him win races over top of climbing linemen. Disciplined gap awareness, but bounces to the play when run lane is declared. Loose hips allow for cover ability from zone. Wide-­armed, wrap-up tackler looking to chest up on each tackle. Not lacking toughness for the middle.	Slender frame that might not carry normal girth for the position. Needs to play with better punch and active hands to stay clean. Can be smothered by size. Gets bounced around when caught up in traffic during flow to the ball. Instincts make him seem more athletic and fast than he might actually be. Lacks sudden twitch and change of direction ability. Lost a couple of races to the perimeter where he had the angle.	Hunter Hillenmeyer	Vigil has the desire and instincts to play in the NFL, but his slim frame and lack of play strength will need to be addressed in the weight room and the training table. Vigil?s athletic scores at the combine could push his draft stock in either direction, but with more mass, he has the ability to stick on a roster even though it may need to be as an outside linebacker in a 4-­3 defense.	\N	73	5.37000000000000011	nick-vigil	\N
2555529	Stephen	Weatherly	13	76	267	10.25	Weatherly possesses one of the more unique family and personal backgrounds among the 2016 draft class, with a grandmother who graduated from Harvard and MIT and the ability to play six musical instruments. On the field, he has grown from a rotation defensive end as a redshirt freshman in 2013 (19 tackles, five for loss, 3.5 sacks) to part-time starter as a 3-4 linebacker (nine starts, 55 tackles, 12.5 for loss, 4.5 sacks) to a team leader (46 tackles, 9.5 for loss, 3.5 sacks). Having nearly completed his degree, Weatherly decided after the season to move on to the NFL as an early draft entrant.	Long-limbed frame with wide hips and a big bubble should handle more muscle. Has experience with a hand down or standing up. Used as A-­gap blitzer at times and showed some slippery to knife through on occasion. Tall and can peek over the fray to find the ball. Closes off the edge to the ball like a freight train when unblocked. Long legs help him range around field and close ground against hesitant runners.	Open-side rusher at Vanderbilt lacking upfield burst. False step, pre-­rush slows him in the race. Rushes with hesitation rather than cutting it loose. Play strength could benefit from greater bend and leverage at the point of attack. Doesn?t utilize length and an effective punch as often as he could. Stays wired to blocks for too long.	Quanterus Smith	Weatherly has the size and overall length to intrigue NFL teams as a developmental prospect, but he will need additional work to become a more competitive pass rusher off the edge. If he can add functional strength while maintaining his closing burst, he may have a role as a backup strong­side OLB in a 3­-4 with a shot at competing as an eventual starter.	\N	87	5.25	stephen-weatherly	\N
2555553	A.J.	Stamps	16	71	193	9.625	If Stamps hadn't requested to move to safety after his first year attending East Mississippi Community College, he might not have received a coveted invitation to the 2016 Scouting Combine. He played defensive back and receiver in high school, and played his first year at EMCC at receiver, catching nine passes for 73 yards. His move to safety proved a prosperous one for him and his team, as his seven tackles for loss, four interceptions, and nine pass break-ups helped EMCC win the national junior college title. The nephew of former NFL running back/returner Sylvester Stamps had little issue with the transition to SEC football in 2013, starting all 12 games and leading the Wildcats with four interceptions. Though his pick total decreased to one in 2015, Stamps made 67 tackles and broke up eight passes to cement his position as a legitimate pro prospect.	Former Juco wide receiver who still flashes excellent hands and ball skills. Decent pattern recognition in man coverage. Former cornerback who can line up over the slot. Has 18 passes defensed over two years at Kentucky. Puts extra pepper into hits at catch point when trying to jar ball loose. Responds quickly to what his eyes tell him from coverage. Chooses path to throw that gives him a chance to make a play.	Wiry build with a frame that may not be able to add good weight. Not always in a hurry to step downhill and mix it up. Scouts question his heart for the physical part of the game. Needs to pursue plays with more consistent motor. Hips hiccup when forced to change direction in coverage. Lacks recovery burst and can get too far behind in coverage. Long speed could be an issue.	\N	Former cornerback and wide receiver who flashes decent ball skills but lacks the aggressive, urgent attitude necessary from the safety position. Teams may choose to try him back at cornerback, but his long speed and recovery acceleration will be question marks heading into the combine.	"There is a play against Florida on the goal line where his run fit opens wide and he has a chance to shoot downhill to make a play to help his team and passes on it. We won't tolerate that." -- AFC area scout	84	4.87999999999999989	a.j.-stamps	\N
2555530	Vonn	Bell	16	71	199	9.5	Bell was a top 30 national recruit out of Georgia, but eschewed the overtures of Alabama and other SEC schools to play for Urban Meyer and the Buckeyes. His faith in Meyer was rewarded with a national championship in 2014, and the fact his team beat Saban's Crimson Tide in the title game was no small irony. Bell got on the field right way for OSU, playing as a reserve at the nickel spot most of his true freshman season before earning a starting spot in the Orange Bowl versus Clemson (seven tackles, interception). He was inserted into one of the safety spots for 14-of-15 contests in the Buckeyes' championship 2014 season, racking up 92 tackles, two for loss, six interceptions and six pass breakups. Though his statistics dropped a bit in his final year in Columbus (65 tackles, two interceptions, nine pass breakups), Bell's play was still impressive enough to receive 2015 second-team All-Big Ten honors from league coaches (first team from the media).	Sheriff mentality looking to corral receivers on his side of the field. Has man cover talent. Instincts and reaction time are big assets. Trusts his eyes and fires downhill as soon as he reads throw. Capacity to meet ball at the catch­ point more than most cover safeties. Credited with 23 passes defensed over last two seasons. Able to mirror targets and strike a centered blow when flowing downhill. Plays with excellent feel for his responsibilities in space. Sifts through route combinations and always gets to his guy. Rarely out of position.	Play speed looked very average on tape. Time­-consuming sprint to boundary from single-­high coverage to help over the top. Hip tightness impedes fluid flip and go when beaten in space. Occasionally gets caught peeking in on quarterback for too long and will briefly lose track of receiver. Against the run, allows running backs to get on top of him and deliver the first blow. Drag down tackler without much thud.	Kurt Coleman	Though lacking in desired size and physicality, Bell has the ability to match up in space and is at his best when keeping the action in front of him where he combines his vision, reactive quickness and ball skills to go make plays on the ball. Bell lacks size and isn't an aggressive tackler so he needs to prove he can run so that he locks in his draft positioning as one of the top free safeties in this draft.	"He's not special, but he's solid. I needed to go see him in person because he looked so small on tape and he looks the same in person. You can't play him around the line of scrimmage, but he's got instincts in coverage." -- AFC scout	37	5.67999999999999972	vonn-bell	\N
2555531	Anthony	Brown	14	71	192	8.25	The Boilermakers had one of the worst pass defenses in college football in 2015, but Brown shouldn't be blamed for that performance. He intercepted four passes on the year (the first four of his career), breaking up six others (giving him 19 in three years as a starter). One of Brown's strengths is his tackling ability (110 in 2014-2015), as he's willing to throw his body into a play. Combining good athleticism with some physicality makes Brown a potential special teams contributor and reserve corner at the next level.	Patient footwork from press coverage. Consistent and effective in zone coverage. Plays with plus field awareness and overall intelligence in space. Solid in bail coverage with balancing eye work between receiver and quarterback and maintaining proper spacing. Diligent against play­-action possibilities near goal line. Has hands to finish with the interception when opportunity arises. Finished with 10 passes defensed in each of the last two years. Provides value in special teams coverage.	On wrong end of entirely too many touchdowns over last three seasons (charged with 17 allowed on 162 targets). Handsy defender at the stem or top of the route. Doesn't trust his technique, and willing to grab and pull rather than work the feet. Charged with six pass interference penalties in 2015. Has some stall when transitioning forward from backpedal and when opening to run from press. Reads pass quickly, but burst to ball is limited. Passive tackler with inconsistent effort against the run.	A.J. Bouye	Extensive tape work is required for Brown because he's much more talented in coverage than his touchdown total. His slight transition stiffness combined with grabby play in man is a concern, but his field vision and discipline from zone will appeal to zone teams. To earn playing time, Brown needs to play to his size and improve his aggressiveness and willingness as a tackler.	\N	39	5.41000000000000014	anthony-brown	\N
2555532	Lamarcus	Brutus	17	72	206	8.75	Most Florida State defensive prospects don't fly in under the radar, but Brutus tends to be overlooked as scouts and fans marvel at the talents of All-American Jalen Ramsey. To be fair, Brutus couldn't get on the field regularly in his first three years on the team due to depth at the position. He played in six games as a redshirt freshman (no statistics) before becoming a regular on special teams (16 tackles) the following year. Brutus earned time as a safety in dime packages in 2014, recording 15 tackles and two interceptions on the year. Once he forced his way into a starting spot as a senior, Seminoles coaches didn't regret putting him in (68 tackles, team-leading three interceptions, one pass breakup).	Plays with above average instincts allowing him to react quickly to play progression. Anticipates route development and flows with it. Able to turn and peddle without issues. Balanced, open-­field tackler who finishes with consistency. Always reading quarterback. Disguises pre-­snap coverage plans.	Struggled to log playing time amongst talented Seminoles roster. Slightly below average size for the position. Man coverage limitations due to lack of speed. Slow twitch, average athlete.	\N	Head coach Jimbo Fisher has praised Brutus for his attitude and work­ ethic in working his way up the food chain with Florida State. Brutus? plays an intelligent, instinct­-based game that puts him in good position most of time, but his lack of speed tends to limit him into deep safety responsibilities much of the time. Might lack the size and speed to make it in the league.	"High-character, worker-­type. Doesn't have enough physical gifts for the position." -- NFC area scout	3	4.95999999999999996	lamarcus-brutus	\N
2555533	Taveze	Calhoun	14	72	192	\N	Calhoun and Will Redmond are trying to become the second cornerback duo from MSU in the last four years to both be drafted in the top 100 selections (Darius Slay, Johnthan Banks in 2013). Calhoun came back from offseason ankle surgery to start for a third straight year as a senior. Not only did he succeed on the field (39 tackles, 6.5 for loss, two interceptions, team-best 10 pass breakups), but he was a finalist for the Campbell Trophy (academic Heisman) and was the SEC?s only National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete. In 2012, he played as a reserve and special teams ace (24 tackles, forced fumble) before getting the starting nod the following year (three interceptions, 101 return yards). Calhoun started all 13 games as a junior, accumulating 53 tackles, an interception, and nine pass breakups.	Tall cornerback with game experience against receivers now in the NFL. Careful against speed across from him and rarely beaten over the top. Exceptionally intelligent and can rapidly process what he sees. Has quick reaction twitch and responsiveness to burst to the throw and make plays on the ball. Good leaper who aggressively rips and slaps at attempted catches. Credited with 27 passes defensed over last three seasons. Comfortable in man­-off coverage. Hit with only one pass interference over last 136 targets. High character person and player on and off the field.	Skinny legs and thin waist. Not strong or physical. Works overtime in run support to unglue from big, blocking receivers on the edge. Ducks head into tackles and often won't see what he's hitting. Tackle strength and consistency are below average. Tall and uneven in his backpedal. Can't carry long speed. Fear of deep ball forces him into early open and retreat. Transition of feet and hips from press coverage is cumbersome. Balance issues pop up all over the game tape.	\N	High-character leader whose overall intelligence translates into positive plays on the field. Calhoun doesn?t have good deep speed but finds ways to cover up his speed deficiency while still making plays on the throws underneath. A failure to run well would be a huge concern because he lacks the physicality as a tackler to be a full­-time zone corner. Late Day 3 draft pick or camp invite might be his door into the NFL.	"Really good kid and high-end leader. I don't know if he will make it in our league, but he's going to be very successful at whatever he does. Coaching staff over at MSU speaks highly of the person and teammate he is. That matters. He's got a chance, but I just don?t think he can run." -- AFC regional scout	92	4.95999999999999996	taveze-calhoun	\N
2555535	DeAndre	Elliott	14	73	188	9.625	Elliott has gone back and forth between part-time starter and full-time starter during his time in Fort Collins, but he has consistently made plays while possessing the size/speed combination NFL scouts look for in cornerbacks. He intercepted two passes in his redshirt freshman (seven starts), junior (six), and senior (11) seasons, picking off one pass in his sophomore (10) year. Elliott returned one of his interceptions for a 76-year touchdown against Hawaii in 2012. He was credited with 27 pass breakups for the Rams over his four-year career.	Good height and arm length for the position. Showed dramatic improvement from last season improving completion percentage against from 57.4 percent to 40.5 percent and reducing touchdowns allowed from five to one. Quick to squeeze his target when route breaks in front of him. Spies quarterback from bail coverage and will break from his path to jump throws or help outside his area. Handles high/low splits from zone coverage with proper balance.	Shows slight balance issues when hitting brakes from his pedal or shuffle. Acceleration from change of direction is delayed. Doesn't have recovery speed to swing and miss underneath. Concern over deep balls force him into early, hard bail. Doesn?t sit as tightly in the pocket in man coverage as teams would like. Always opts for safest angle possible in run support rather than making the impactful tackle.	\N	Tall cornerback who played with a much greater technique and understanding of his responsibilities in coverage in this year over last. While his height will get him attention, his lack of recovery speed might concern teams.	\N	76	5	deandre-elliott	\N
2555536	Kavon	Frazier	17	72	217	\N	Frazier garnered second-team All-MAC recognition in his senior season (led team with 108 tackles, 4.5 for loss), but the largest honor he received was being able to wear the No. 21 jersey of his former friend and teammate, Derrick Nash. Nash passed away from leukemia in June 2015, and coaches decided to rotate the 21 jersey throughout the season as a way of honoring his memory. Frazier got to wear the jersey twice, including in the team's bowl game. Before 2015, Frazier played as a reserve in 2012 (36 tackles, one interception, three pass breakups), earned more playing time as a sophomore (67 tackles, three interceptions, five pass breakups), and went back to a partial starter in 2014 (58 stops, four pass break-ups).	Has the physical build of a grown, NFL man with broad shoulders and muscular frame. Classic, height/weight/speed prospect. Comes downhill looking for work in run support. Explodes through his target as a hitter and looks to make statements. Has experience high and low as a safety. Good stop-start foot quickness for a big safety. Special teams demon with 14 tackles in punt and kick coverage over the last two seasons. His college coach was a long­time NFL special teams coordinator who praises Frazier's special teams potential. Should test well at the combine.	Strong desire to thump against the run forces him out of position when biting on play­action. His downhill tracks sometimes include questionable angles to the ball and he will run himself into traffic and lose contain. Has issues overreacting to head fakes at the break points of routes. Shows some confusion sifting through combo routes at times. Average instincts from zone and is slow to anticipate quarterback's intentions.	Barry Church	Frazier will immediately appeal to teams who value the eye test as he's big, physical and athletic, but his true draft value could lie in a team?s willingness to buy into him as a functional safety in coverage. Frazier's ability to support against the run and contribute immediately on special teams should lead to a third-day selection and an early backup role with a chance to compete for a starting spot down the road.	"I really like his potential because he's a big athlete who will hit you and immediately brings special teams value to the table." -- NFC South scout	103	5.37000000000000011	kavon-frazier	\N
2555537	T.J.	Green	16	74	209	9.625	Green was a lightly-regarded two-star recruit out of Alabama when Clemson made a scholarship offer -- one of only two major programs to do so. Even though the other was his favorite school growing up, Auburn, he took a chance on Clemson, and it paid off well. He worked at the receiver position as a true freshman, catching two passes and returning three kicks in 12 games. Coaches moved him to safety after the season, with the hopes he could make a bigger impact -- figuratively and literally. As a sophomore he started once and played as a reserve in 10 other contests, recording 24 tackles and one interception, in addition to returning kicks full-time (445 yards). His game took a big leap in 2015, as Green and his roommate, Jayron Kearse, formed one of the tallest and most feared safety duos in the country. He finished second on the team with 95 tackles, 5.5 for loss, broke up three passes and forced two fumbles as the Tigers run at an undefeated season went all the way to the final game of the year.	Former wide receiver turned safety. Speedster who had a few "walk down" tackles coming from way behind to make tackles on breakaways. Has exciting coverage range potential for defense that asks more of him. Flashes man cover ability with length, speed, and balls skills associated with being a former receiver. Asked to walk down into the box and handle run support duties from time to time. Lightning fast blitzer who can factor off the slot. Patterns his game after Chiefs safety Eric Berry. Returned kickoffs in 2014.	Open-field tackling issues are problematic. Too much shoulder hits and not enough wrap ups. Positioning and balance when tackling is below average. Credited with 17 missed or broken tackles in 2015. One-year starter. Asked to play so much high safety that his coverage opportunities and experience is limited. Hesitates to fire downhill after the run or catch, giving away valuable yardage. Instincts a work in progress missing opportunities to take chances and make plays on the ball.	Cedric Thompson	Height/weight/speed prospect who appears to be heating up around draft circles. With just one year of full-time starting experience and so much dead tape due to deep coverage responsibilities, teams will have a limited sample size to operate from, but traits usually win out. If Green hits a fast 40 at the combine (as expected), his stock will get a bump. Green?s coverage potential is evident, but he might need time on the bench to watch and learn early on.	"There is a buzz going around about him from some people I talk to on a regular basis but I'm not sure where it is coming from. He's fast, but what else?" -- NFC executive	1	5.41000000000000014	t.j.-green	\N
2555538	De'Vante	Harris	14	71	176	8.125	Growing up as the son of a former NFL player (Rod Harris played four years after drafted in the fourth round by the Houston Oilers in 1989) and Aggie career record holder for kick return yards, it's no surprise that Harris attended A&amp;M and excelled throughout his time there. The four-star recruit earned his way on the field for seven starts as a true freshman, making 30 tackles, 2.5 for loss, intercepting one pass and breaking up three others. Harris became the full-time starter in 2013 (56 tackles, 2.5 for loss, one INT, eight PBU) but struggled through fall camp and the early part of the 2014 season with an injury (six starts in 10 games, 53 stops, one INT, five PBU). Healthy again for most of his senior campaign, Harris picked off two passes and broke up eight others, displaying enough talent to potentially follow in his father's footsteps as an NFL draftee.	Plays with plus instincts and locks in on quarterback to read his intentions. Able to step outside his area and go make a play on the ball. Plays with rapid response to the throw. Understands the game and gets secondary line up. Very communicative on the field. Plays with tremendous confidence. Loves to come downhill and strike incoming receivers with authority. Runs through his targets and delivers as much pop as his thin frame can muster.	Played more bail and off coverage this season after big receivers bounced him around from press coverage in 2014. Willing hitter, but slides off of too many tackles allowing for additional yardage after contact. Play strength in run support and against big targets is below NFL standards. Recovery speed is average.	\N	Intelligent and instinctive, Harris has been a rock­-steady contributor for the Texas A&amp;M defense from the moment he stepped on campus. With a rail-­thin frame and an inability to consistently tackle, Harris needs a big combine to improve his opportunity to hear his name called during the draft.	"He believes he's the best player on the field at all times. I love that. If he had about 20 more pounds on those bones we might be looking at something, but I think he's late Day 3 to undrafted." -- AFC area scout	20	5	devante-harris	\N
2555539	Xavien	Howard	14	72	201	9.125	After two years of watching the Baylor defense from the sidelines, Howard was enough of a playmaker as a sophomore and junior that he left early for the NFL. He redshirted in 2012, and then had five tackles as a reserve cornerback and special teamer the following year. Howard worked his way onto the field as a sophomore and never left, starting all 26 games over the past two seasons. He used his NFL-sized frame to make 93 tackles as well as led the team in interceptions (four in 2014, five in 2015) and pass breakups (13, 10) in both years, twice garnering honorable mention All-Big 12 notice from league coaches.	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	10	5.59999999999999964	xavien-howard	\N
2555540	Derrick	Kindred	16	70	207	9.375	There's toughness, and then there's Derrick Kindred. During the 2015 Alamo Bowl press conference, he stated he broke his collarbone three days before the start of his senior season, but decided to play through the injury. It's difficult enough to play a thumper at the safety position, which Kindred is, with a mostly healthy body. But to be a first-team All-Big 12 defensive back with 87 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and three pass breakups -- well, that?s pretty impressive. Kindred had already secured a leadership role on the defense as a junior, receiving honorable mention All-Big 12 notice (80 tackles, 4.5 for loss, four interceptions, five pass breakups). Kindred returned two of his six interceptions for touchdowns during the 2014-2015 seasons, as well. He had his first taste as a starter in his freshman year, starting once in 12 contests (20 tackles, two pass break-ups), and then stepped up again when needed as a sophomore, beginning three contests and playing in every game (48 stops, four for loss, two INT, five PBU).	Compact build with aggressive field demeanor. Will drop bombs on ball carriers and receivers when he gets his chance. Accelerates through his targets for maximum pop. Has toughness and strength of an NFL box safety. Decent straight-line speed from the hash and as a downhill tackler. Has some cover talent if matched up underneath. Had 21 passes defensed and eight interceptions over last two seasons. Plays on both punt and kick coverage teams and loves to intimidate with big hits on return men.	At times will opt to chop runner's legs from under them over wrapping up. Big hit hunting has consequences. Missed 16 tackles last year and 26 over last two seasons, in part, due to issues with direction change. Can be juked in open field. Glides toward perimeter run support and creating high-­risk tackle angles and diving attempts. Hip stiffness and inconsistency with deep ball responsibilities are major concerns in deep coverage.	\N	Kindred is an intimidating hitter with pretty good ball skills, but his issues with missed tackles and back-end busts are a concern. The more area he's asked to cover, the more he is likely to struggle, so he could be locked in as a box safety with special teams value. Kindred could go undrafted, but he he's got enough talent to fight for a roster spot.	"He plays it like we used to play it back in the day. He's going to bring it to you, no doubt, but the way the league is set up now, he has to be able to cover. Probably a (special) teams guy and fourth safety." -- NFC scout	63	5.11000000000000032	derrick-kindred	\N
2555541	Jordan	Lomax	16	70	202	8.75	After three years of waiting his turn to get on the field, including a lost 2012 season due to a spring shoulder injury and 2013 season where he missed four more games due to injury, Lomax finally earned the starting nod in 2014 -- and stayed healthy. He put forth an honorable mention All-Big Ten effort at safety (he started his Iowa career at cornerback), making 92 tackles, intercepting a pass and breaking up six others. Lomax followed that up with a third team all-conference campaign (96 tackles, one interception, six pass break-ups), where he used his compact build and athleticism to patrol the secondary for the Hawkeyes.	Aggressive, willing demeanor in run support. Loves to hit. Will get his licks in when he gets a chance. Might offer kickoff coverage value. Closes hard on receivers drifting into his area for the catch and can land a disruptive strike to jar ball free. Former cornerback with enough twitch to slam on brakes from backpedal and burst downhill. Hard worker in the classroom and weight room and noted team leader.	Stout but short safety with small hands. Carries longer torso on shorter legs. Hesitates to jump routes on crossers and slants in front of him. Lacks play­making instincts and length. Had just two interceptions in two years as starter. More buildup acceleration than short area burst in coverage. Great hitter, but average finisher. Questionable angles and poor space adjustment led to 29 broken or missed tackles as a starter.	\N	Physical hitter who plays with desire and urgency, but lacks the physical traits and downhill cover skills teams covet at the position. Comparisons to Bob Sanders by locals is understandable due to his frame and physicality, but Lomax lacks the juice and top-­end speed that Sanders possessed.	"He's short but he's pretty well built so that shouldn't kill his chances. He's not a reliable tackler in space and if he doesn't run really well he won't drafted. He'll be in a camp though." -- NFC East area scout	32	4.99000000000000021	jordan-lomax	\N
2555542	Jordan	Lucas	17	72	201	\N	Lucas was the first recruit to sign on with Bill O?Brien as the Nittany Lions fought through the rough times of the post-Joe Paterno era. He has played corner using his tenacious man-cover skills, and was also physical enough to move to safety (58 tackles, four for loss, two sacks along with nine passes defensed in 2014). His senior year was cut short due to injury (56 tackles, three pass breakups in nine starts), but Lucas could be a nice option in the slot for teams looking to regularly bring pressure from that area. Versatility is crucial in today's NFL, and Lucas has plenty to spare.	Team captain and three-year starter. Played cornerback two years before moving to safety this year. Praised for his character and leadership. Doesn't need much runway to hit his burst gear to close. Plays with smooth feet and change of direction for the safety spot. Takes smart angles to the ball and rarely runs himself out of a play. Lined up over slots in sub-­packages.	Has short arms and marginal speed. Lacks play­making instincts to put him in position to make more plays. Always seems to be a step slow to the ball from the safety spot. Labored disengage in run support when blocked by tight ends near line of scrimmage. Missed final three games and Senior Bowl with shoulder injury that will be combed over at combine. Hits like a cornerback.	\N	Has good size for a cornerback and was credited with 25 passes defensed (including three interceptions) when he played that position so teams may look to move him back there. Lucas' lack of speed could be an issue at cornerback and his marginal play­making instincts aren't endearing at the safety spot so he might have to shine on special teams to get a foot in the door early on.	\N	38	5.11000000000000032	jordan-lucas	\N
2555543	Keanu	Neal	17	72	211	10.625	Some safeties are content with "catching" ball-carriers during their tackle attempts. Neal prefers to make sure those with the ball have nightmares about "42" coming their way. The Florida high school all-state pick (151 tackles as a junior) stepped in to tie for the team lead in special teams tackles as a freshman, along with playing a reserve role at safety (five tackles on the year). Neal got the start in eight contests as a sophomore, missing two games with an injury but still managing 45 tackles and racking up three interceptions. He also missed the first two games of the 2015 season with an injured hamstring, but finished with 96 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two sacks, and one interception. Neal joined cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III in leaving for the NFL early after his outstanding junior year.	Athletic frame with NFL size. Quick-­twitch player cranks it up to top speed in a hurry. Explodes downhill in run support with blood in his eyes. Vicious hitter looking to bruise bones and set tones. Rangy run stopper. Drives all the way through his contact with aggressive finishes. Scouts impressed by his personal character. Good click and close skill in coverage. Is on top of receiver immediately after the catch. Worked from the box and as single high safety at Florida. Impact tackler around the line of scrimmage. Plays with a sense of desperation and rarely fatigues.	Will have to make business decisions regarding when to bang and when to simply tackle in order to save his body. "Hulk smash" playing style led to 15 missed or broken tackles in 2015. Can be wild in space skating past his target. Field awareness can be hit or miss in coverage. Will lose track of deep ball responsibility from time to time. Won't always turn and run early enough.	Kenny Vaccaro	Neal started the year off with a hamstring issue that slowed him down and caused some uneven tape at times, but his size, athleticism and hitting are the best in this draft. Neal isn't limited to simple box tasks even though he thrives there. He has all the makings of an early starter and may hear his name called earlier than some might project.	"He looks like an NFL safety. Looks like he can run on tape and is exactly what you look for in run support. He's an athlete so I don't worry about his cover skills as long as his instincts are okay." -- NFC defensive backs coach	82	5.84999999999999964	keanu-neal	\N
2555544	Jimmy	Pruitt	14	72	198	9.375	A versatile defender who has started at corner and safety for the Spartans, Pruitt played with the first-team defense at corner as a true freshman (41 tackles, one interception, 11 pass breakups). Though not a huge hitter, Pruitt is physical enough to have handled duties in the back half as a sophomore (52 tackles). He moved back to the corner spot for his junior and senior seasons, intercepting three passes and breaking up seven others in honorable mention All-Mountain West efforts the past two years.	Has experience starting at both safety and cornerback. Very rarely burned and maintains solid feel for his man. Allowed just one touchdown over last 103 targets. Diligent against double moves and rarely bites hard on first sign of breaks by wide out. Plays with route recognition in both man and zone and will take shots to jump the route from time to time. Has 18 passes defensed over last two seasons, including six interceptions. Has adequate reactive footwork and shows little indecision when responding to his eyes.	Not aggressive enough in run support to transition to full-time safety. Has short arms for a cornerback. Allows too much operating room from off-­man bail coverage and needs to squeeze routes a little tighter. Slow to find and track ball down the field. Gets to top gear quickly, but long speed appears to be average at best. Ankle-­tackler willing to sit on blocks for too long rather than attack and defeat.	\N	Consistent three­-year starter who plays with a good head on his shoulders when it comes to coverage responsibilities. Pruitt shows a good feel for space and keying the quarterback's eyes from zone coverage and he's always around his responsibility in man coverage. However, his man coverage could be a little tighter, his speed could be better and his tackling could be more aggressive. Likely third-day option with backup potential.	\N	115	5.08999999999999986	jimmy-pruitt	\N
2555545	Will	Redmond	14	71	182	9.125	A four-star recruit from Memphis, Redmond got caught up in a recruiting mess that gave him and his family impermissible benefits. The NCAA investigated the situation, and did not allow him to play as a freshman at MSU. Redmond only played in eight games as a sophomore and didn't start a game for the Bulldogs in 2014 because of the depth they had at the position. Still, teams made a mistake throwing his way that year as he had a team-best three interceptions (along with five breakups) as a junior. Two of those interceptions sealed victories for Mississippi State in the fourth quarter. Once Redmond finally got the starting job as a senior (25 tackles, two INT, one PBU), he could only watch the second half of the season after tearing his right ACL in practice. But NFL teams won't forget the athleticism and toughness he showed in the 19 games he played in 2014-2015.	Plus athleticism for the position. Plays with desired twitch and foot quickness. Has the physical tools to match up in tight, man coverage and mirror receiver with quality pattern recognition. Has burst to close out throws quickly and challenge the catch. Aggressive and determined in run support. Unafraid to step downhill challenge the run on his terms and near the line of scrimmage.	Average size for the perimeter. Combines height/weight will be important for him. Transition from physical downfield approach to NFL rules could be challenging early on. Takes chances that pulls him out of position. ACL tear in 2015 puts 2016 in limbo. Open field tackling can be an issue. Was on pace to miss almost 20 tackles before injury. Looks to drop hammers rather than wrap up. Has very few college starts.	Kyle Arrington	Redmond's quickness, feet and man cover ability will be intriguing to NFL evaluators, but his lack of game experience on the college level and a return from an ACL tear could weigh heavily on a team's willingness to spend an early round pick on him. His ceiling is NFL starter, but his floor is obviously low.	\N	92	5.59999999999999964	will-redmond	\N
2555546	Rashard	Robinson	14	73	171	\N	Robinson's talent was never an issue during his time in Baton Rouge, but staying on the field was problematic. He barely made the deadline for eligibility before his freshman season, but ended up playing in 12 games with two starts (16 tackles, interception, three pass break-ups). In 2014, he was not allowed to dress for the season opener against Wisconsin and started six of eight games played (17 tackles, one pass breakup) before being suspended indefinitely in November. Head coach Les Miles never reinstated Robinson for the 2015 season, so the defender sat out the season instead of transferring to another school. Without hope of re-joining the team in 2016, he entered the NFL draft as an early entrant.	Tremendously long athlete with absolutely blazing straight line speed. Scouts believe he could have one of the top 40-yard dash times at the combine. Recovery speed allows him to sit on short and intermediate routes. Can flip hips and accelerate with his man down the field. Smooth change of speed to mirror double movers. Thin, but not soft. Plays to his height and it often spells doom when he has receivers pinned against the sideline. In 2013, held then-Aggie Mike Evans to four catches for 51 yards. Willing to do his part when he has to tackle. Explosive from stand­still and can close quickly on throws or receivers.	Due to off­-field issues, has limited game experience and ball production. Feet become impatient from press and he opens early at the first sign of a head fake. Spindly legs may be close to maxed out in terms of size. Run support may be an issue when he has to disengage against NFL size. Arrested in June of 2015 and charged with unauthorized entry in connection with a theft from the apartment of one of Robinson's former teammates. Has admitted to being "selfish" while at LSU.	Dominique Rodgers-­Cromartie	He might look like he skipped "leg day" for several years, but his height, speed and man-­cover talent is undeniable. Robinson has the traits and talent to be considered one of the best press corners in this draft, but teams will have to weigh the character against the talent. Look for an electric combine which could create new buzz around the former LSU Tiger. Robinson has the raw ability to become a good NFL starter who can play on an island if asked, but I am downgrading his draft grade due to his character concerns.	"I'm not sure he's a bad kid, but I know he hates school. He's really tough -- ­typical south Florida kid. You know what you get. The interviews will work themselves out for better or worse, but you keep things simple for him and let him chase one guy around the field all day. He's really good at that." -- Former SEC defensive coach	91	5.74000000000000021	rashard-robinson	\N
2555547	KeiVarae	Russell	14	71	192	\N	The story of Russell's career at Notre Dame took a sharp left turn in August of 2014, as he and four of his teammates were suspended for academic improprieties. The prolonged investigative process cost him the 2014 season and 2014-15 school year, although he kept himself busy with community college courses, a job, and a strong workout program so he could return in 2015. He started 11 games for the Irish in his final season on campus, making 60 tackles, 3.5 for loss, two interceptions and four pass breakups. Russell was actually considered one of the top running back recruits in the country coming out of high school, but moved to the secondary for the Irish before his freshman season. The move paid immediate dividends, as he started all 13 games earning Freshman All-American honors (58 tackles, two interceptions). Russell started every game again in 2013 (51 tackles, eight pass breakups), finishing strong with his lone interception of the year and three pass breakups against Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl.	First-day starter from the time he stepped foot on campus. Angular athletic build. Plays fast. Smooth hips and light feet opening from press. Plus route recognition. Anticipates and mirrors routes in space sitting in receiver's pocket along the route. Quick responder to play­action and sprints back into his responsibility. Observant from zone and off coverage. Shows recovery speed needed against long speed. Looks to do it the right way as tackler. Strikes with chest or shoulder and wraps up.	Can be posted up by size. Flat­footed pedal slows plant-­and­-close ability. Displays some balance inconsistency in change of direction. Ball skills can use work. Hyper­-focuses on his man rather than finding the ball and making a play. Can speed reaction time to what quarterback's eyes are telling him. Broken fibula at the end of 2015 creates medical concern. Missed all of 2014 due to "academic dishonesty".	Aaron Colvin	Smart, experienced cornerback has strapped it on against some of the best receivers in the nation during his time with the Irish. Russell has the athleticism and cover talent to play press coverage and make a living there, but he may never produce as many pass break­ups or interceptions as a team would like. Played outside and from the slot and offers that versatility to an NFL team as a future starter or third corner.	"He has second day talent as a cover corner, but he's not as big as you want and now the broken legs might complicate things." -- AFC regional scout	43	5.58999999999999986	keivarae-russell	\N
2555554	Cleveland	Wallace	14	71	188	9.5	Wallace intended on going away from home to experience college life in Seattle, playing for the University of Washington after a strong high school career at Oak Grove High School in San Jose. But after a redshirt season (where he won the team's Special Teams Scout Team MVP) and another year as a reserve and special teams player (nine tackles), he transferred to San Jose State to take care of a family issue. The NCAA waived the typical transfer season due to his circumstances, allowing Wallace to garner second team All-Mountain West accolades in his first year as a starter. He tied for seventh nationally with 14 pass breakups that season to go along with 26 tackles and one interception. Wallace and fellow starting corner Jimmy Pruitt both received honorable mention all-conference nods in 2015, both with three interceptions. Wallace broke up eight additional passes on the year and was credited with 44 tackles.	Fluid feet from press and can pedal and mirror receiver throughout the route. Has springs in his hips. Instant gear down and change of direction ability to close out throws. Instinctive with advanced feel for pattern recognition. Credited with 23 passes defensed over last two seasons. Able to change pace of bail coverage to match receiver?s speed and maintain tighter coverage. Lurker from zone looking to pounce on telegraphed throws. Can leap and challenge against size and has enough long speed.	Atrocious tackler. Lacks necessary size and toughness to finish the job. Failed on 20 percent (broken or missed) of his tackle attempts this year. Thin with very little pop in his pads. Finesse player. Got "big-boyed" several times by BYU's big receivers down the field. Doesn't find ball quickly when matching receiver down the field.	Bobby McCain	Field corner with twitchy hips and some of the cleanest "mirror and match" footwork in this draft. Wallace has the ability to challenge plenty of throws because of his instincts, feet and smooth transitions, but his lack of size and strength hurt him against "post­ up" receivers. Even more alarming is his lack of competitiveness as a tackler. Wallace has the cover talent to challenge for third corner responsibilities early in his career.	"Good instincts and he's athletic, but he's just so small. He has to move inside, I would think, because he's not physical enough to handle NFL size." -- NFC West area scout	115	5.29999999999999982	cleveland-wallace	\N
2555548	Zack	Sanchez	14	71	185	9.375	A two-time first-team All-Big 12 pick from Fort Worth, Texas, Sanchez has been a stalwart for the Sooners since taking the starting job as a redshirt freshman in 2013. He started 37 games over the past three years, missing two games this fall with a right leg injury. His slight frame worries scouts, and some questioned Sanchez's decision to leave early for the NFL, but there's no doubting his ability to play the ball (15 interceptions, 28 pass break-ups over the past three seasons). Sanchez received 2015 second team All-American notice from multiple outlets, as he not only picked off seven passes, but had 45 tackles, 3.5 for loss, and seven pass breakups.	Three-year starter. Outstanding ball production has been his calling card. Grabbed 15 interceptions during three-year career. Always looking to take the ball reading the quarterback's eyes and taking sharp angles on the throw. Has the hands and athleticism to make difficult interceptions. Great spatial feel in zone shifting from receiver to receiver and squeezing throwing windows. Mirror and match footwork combined with route recognition from man-­off gives him playmaking opportunities. Carries long speed to challenge vertical targets.	Short and rail thin for an outside cornerback. Inconsistent tackler due to size. May not have enough sand to hold up against physical receivers. Reckless habit of diving head first on slant looks only to be burned by "sluggo" (slant and go) routes. Doesn't play as fast as his forty time. Allowed 12 touchdowns over last three years and that number should have been higher (drops/overthrows). Can be turned around by clever routes. Average closing burst out of backpedal.	Patrick Robinson	Experienced cornerback who has cover experience against current and future NFL receivers. Sanchez is a feast or famine cover man whose instincts run him into interceptions but also into aggressive mistakes that can cost his own team. His lack of size will work against him on draft day, but his ball production will be heavily weighed by teams looking for coverage help from a third cornerback.	"He is fast and talented. I'm always partial to guys who make plays on the ball so I like him. I don't think he's tough enough to tackle so he is probably just a true nickel cornerback who you have to play outside so teams can't run it at him in the slot." -- NFC director of scouting	17	5.54000000000000004	zack-sanchez	\N
2555549	Kevon	Seymour	14	71	186	\N	Seymour expected to pair with super sophomore Adoreé Jackson in 2015 to form one of the best cornerback duos in the country. In his second year as a starter, he led USC with 13 pass breakups in 2014 and intercepted his second career pass as well. The 2011 high school All-American earned that starting role as a sophomore in 2013, making 48 tackles and breaking up seven passes. Knee and ankle injuries cost Seymour playing time in his senior season, however, so he could only start four times in 11 appearances (24 tackles, one interception).	Plays with good recognition from zone. Easy opener to mirror down the field. Has burst and overall speed to run with crossing routes. Has sticky feet and can close on the ball with some suddenness. Special teams standout with 19 tackles over the last three years and eight this season. Might have value as a gunner. Plays speed is NFL-­caliber.	Missed four games due to injury and was benched before the second game of the season and never regained his spot. Despite foot quickness doesn't make as many plays on the ball as expected. Has just three interceptions over three years. Can be big-­boyed by physical receivers inside the routes. Allowed entirely too much for catch­-and­-throw opportunities. Slightly undersized with herky-­jerky change of direction.	\N	Seymour's lost playing time coupled with his injury issues do not bode well for his draft standing, but he's got decent size and quality speed and athleticism doesn't appear to be a problem. Seymour needs to prove he can be a more physical tackler and he might be better suited playing for a defense that stresses man­-off coverage.	\N	50	5.15000000000000036	kevon-seymour	\N
2555550	Justin	Simmons	16	74	202	9.625	Not only is Simmons an all-conference performer for the Eagles, but he's already looking forward to a coaching career after his playing days, working with kids in the Pop Warner program. He might have to wait a while before keeping a whistle around his neck, however, because of his length and versatility. Simmons started off his collegiate career strong, starting seven games as a true freshman (six at free safety, one at cornerback), making 52 tackles, one interception, and four pass breakups. He stepped back a bit as a sophomore (no starts, 34 tackles, three pass break-ups), but got back into the groove in 2014, starting all 13 games, the first six at free safety, final six at cornerback due to injuries at the position. Simmons actually led the team that season with 76 tackles and two interceptions, while breaking up five passes. He capped off his career with a second team all-conference effort in 2015, leading the team with five interceptions as a full-time starter at free safety.	Effective in "robber" role when called on. Able to process layered routes in front of him and find his fit. Consistent in coverage and reads play development quickly. Has cornerback experience and can handle man coverage against move tight ends and bigger slots. Rangy from center field with length and hands for optimal ball skills and makes plays when he gets there. Will sprint from high to low as soon as he reads run and leverages well to the sideline. Showed improved tackle security from 2014 to 2015. Rarely tries to initiate tackle early. Allowed no broken tackles and just four missed tackles this year. Has talent as a gunner and was used on both punt and kick cover teams.	Possesses thin, lanky frame that doesn't have much room for additional bulk. Can be dragged for a ride against size when tackling. Hip tightness creates some clunkiness when forced to change directions quickly. Will shut down his deep cover responsibilities prematurely. Becomes spectator rather than participant if he feels like he can?t range to deep balls outside the numbers. As single high safety, can be fooled into over-committing to a side by clever quarterbacks who lead him with false glances.	\N	Simmons has interceptions against Deshaun Watson, Jacoby Brissett and two against Notre Dame, and was one of the standouts at Shrine Game practices showing off his instincts and ball skills. Despite his thin frame, Simmons tackles with urgency and doesn't lack toughness for the position. With range, length, cover skills and special teams ability Simmons should hear his name called on the third day of the draft and could become an eventual starter.	\N	22	5.36000000000000032	justin-simmons	\N
2555551	LeShaun	Sims	14	72	203	8.125	Southern Utah is typically not a hotbed of NFL talent. However, Sims joins defensive end James Cowser and safety Miles Killebrew as three draftable prospects in the 2016 class. The corner came from Andre Agassi Prep in Nevada, which was a eight-man football program when he was a freshman. Sims was a third-team All-Big Sky Conference selection as a junior, and has used his size and tenacious nature to intercept six passes and break up 15 others in his first three years. He projects as a press corner at the next level, and will get a chance to show scouts at a postseason all-star game whether he has the speed and change of direction ability to stay in the hop pocket of NFL receivers.	Good height, weight and speed for the position. Added 20 pounds to his frame since coming on campus. Ran a verified 4.41 in the spring. Constant annoyance to receivers getting into their framework with jabs from press and then crowding them throughout their route. Effective worker from press with well-­timed opening of hips to run. Has transition quickness downhill to disrupt the catch. Solid mirror and match technique in man cover.	Faced off against below average receiver quality. Shows some balance issues when attempting to fire downhill from his bail technique. Would like to see more tenacity from him in run support. Is slow to come downhill to attack the run and when he does, has issues getting off the block. Has extremely small hands for a football player measuring under 8 inches.	\N	Ascending prospect who caught the attention of NFL scouts at the Shrine Game. Sims has the desired size and speed at cornerback and has adequate footwork to handle himself as a press-­man corner despite needing to step up his aggression against the run. A good combine could put his name in the discussion as one of the better small-school prospects in this draft.	\N	380	5.45000000000000018	leshaun-sims	\N
2555555	D.J.	White	14	71	193	9.25	White made one of the more impressive plays of the 2014 season when he used his speed to chase down Pitt star running back James Conner on a 74-yard run to knock the ball out just before they reached the end zone. That hustle combined with his ability to make plays in coverage turned White into an honorable mention All-ACC selection in 2014 (team-best four interceptions, eight pass breakups). He played well again as a senior (41 tackles, two interceptions, eight pass breakups), making himself a coveted prospect at a prime position.	Team captain and three-year starter. Patient from press coverage and plays with balance. Disrupts receivers with well-­placed jabs. Plays with desired feel for his man throughout the route, working to stay in his pocket. Good short-area quicks to squeeze routes and close on throws. Challenges catch without running through receivers. Good leaper with high-­point ability. Instinctive and disciplined. Attacks catch point rather than man when in position. Forced a fumble all four years at Ga Tech. Should not be limited by scheme.	Needs to get head around earlier with back to the ball. A little clunky flipping hips and changing directions sharply. Recovery speed is very average. Play strength needs improvement to challenge NFL size on perimeter. Waits on receiver after short catch giving away valuable yards after catch rather than attacking downhill. Head ducker in run support and finishes with arm tackles over chest­-up approach.	Justin Bethel	While White is just a shade smaller and slower than teams usually like outside, he makes up for it with his instincts, athleticism and cover skills. White is relatively clean in coverage and is able to stick to his targets, but may not take enough chances to become a ball ­hawk who takes the ball away. White's ball skills and feel for the position could put him in position for early snaps as a third corner and he has eventual starter potential.	\N	4	5.55999999999999961	d.j.-white	\N
2555556	Brandon	Williams	14	71	197	8.625	Oklahoma claimed a major recruiting victory by bringing in the five-star, top-20 overall recruit out of Texas. Williams played eight games as a true freshman (219 rush yards), suffering a neck injury in the finale, from which he fully recovered. However, the Sooners' logjam at the running back position and Williams' desire to be closer to his young daughter caused him to transfer to A&amp;M. He attempted to have the NCAA waive the transfer requirement of sitting out a season, but was denied. Williams played a part in the Aggies' offense in 2013 (44-269, one touchdown) and 2014 (379 yards, three touchdowns; 9-65 receiving) before switching to the cornerback position. He wound up starting all 13 games last fall at that position, making 37 tackles, one for loss, and seven pass breakups. The athleticism he showed on defense gave NFL scouts enough to chew on that they pushed for his inclusion in the 2016 NFL Scouting Combine.	Has very good size and overall build for the position. Extremely raw, but has projectable NFL traits. Flashed a quality burst to the ball from his backpedal. Steady and sure tackler with enough mass on his frame to hit and stick to big receivers and running backs coming his way. Blazing straight-line recovery speed. Has potential to be a very good cover man as gunner on punt coverage.	Has just one season of experience at the position. Learning curve is unpredictable and could be prolonged. Slow to process combo routes and find shifting zone responsibilities. Still learning to sit in receiver's pocket when he's pinned to the sideline. Faster than quick and allows entirely too much separation at this juncture. Stiff in his transition and missing confidence and instincts at this time.	Nick Marshall	Williams began his transition from running back to cornerback in fall camp so any draft grades that NFL teams give him will be based purely on projection. The tape was often unkind to Williams who had to face off against SEC competition with nothing more than athleticism and guile. NFL teams will look at the traits and see a player who fits the mold and who should improve with more coaching. Williams could be drafted substantially higher than my grade based on traits, but there is no guarantee he will progress quickly enough to stick long-term.	"He's going to have a great workout at the combine and get overdrafted. Frankly, I was surprised he was even invited." --­ NFC area scout	20	5.21999999999999975	brandon-williams	\N
2555557	Brad	Craddock	18	72	186	8.25	This native Australian (the top Aussie recruit according to special teams expert Chris Sailer) won the Lou Groza Award, AP second team All-American notice, and Big Ten Kicker of the Year awards as a junior after hitting 18 of 19 field goal attempts, including a 57-yarder and a game-winner against Penn State. He also made multiple touchdown-saving tackles on kickoffs. Craddock had shown potential before that, making 21 of 25 field goal attempts in 2013 and contributing as a placekicker and kickoff specialist as a true freshman. Unfortunately, he only played nine games last fall (8-10 on field goals, 22-23 on extra points) as a dislocated bone in his right hand sidelined him for the rest of the year. Adding insult to injury, Craddock's missed tackle resulted in 98-yard touchdown for Wisconsin, who won the game by seven points.	Plus trajectory on his kicks and has never had a field goal or extra point blocked. Field goal accuracy was 80 percent or higher (including 94.7 percent) in every season as kicker. Has athleticism to make touchdown saving tackles and is unafraid to step into the fray. Outstanding mark of 30 for 32 from 30-­49 yards over last three seasons. Had a make of 57 yards in 2014.	Missed final three games with a wrist injury sustained while trying to make a diving tackle. Needs much more hang ­time on kickoffs. Has a very average kickoff leg and allowed a high percentage of kicks to be returned.	\N	Craddock's consistency from intermediate ranges will get the attention of teams as he's put together three solid years from that range. His biggest challenge is trying to improve his kickoffs as teams usually don't like having to carry a kick­off specialist.	\N	5	5.07000000000000028	brad-craddock	\N
2555558	Lac	Edwards	19	76	209	9.375	Edwards is part of the "Australian Invasion", the movement of many colleges to find kickers and punters from Down Under due to their experience in Aussie Rules Football. Not only did Edwards excel in that sport, but also rugby, cricket, and track and field at Ballarat University in 2012. He shared punting duties in his first year in the United States in 2013, averaging 42.3 yards on 31 punts, forcing 10 fair catches and placing 13 inside the 20 yard-line. Edwards took the starting job by the reins the following year, earning first-team All-Southland Conference honors and FCS All-American notice (44.1 average, 22 fair catches, 28 inside the 20 versus just five touchbacks). His gross average dipped in 2015 (41.5) but Edwards still received second-team All-Southland notice by placing 31-of-74 kicks inside the 20 and forcing 19 fair catches.	Good size for the position. Discovered while kicking in a park in Australia. Has enough leg to post NFL-caliber hang times. Despite arrival from Australia, is not a rugby style punter. For his career has dropped 38.9 percent of his punts inside 20-yard line.	Team had no deep field goal kicker so he was used for several pooch punts. Teams unsure about consistent ability to boom punts out of his own end zone to flip the field.	\N	Edwards is one of the new breed of punters coming over from Australia and making their mark in college football. With very good size and solid hang ­time, Edwards has a chance to stand­out at the combine if he can mash and maintain his hang time.	\N	356	4.87999999999999989	lac-edwards	\N
2555559	Tom	Hackett	19	70	198	9.25	After an outstanding senior season, Hackett became the second punter to twice win the Ray Guy Award as the nation's top punter, joining current New England Patriots punter Ryan Allen in that feat. The Australia native finished second in the FBS with a 47.95-yard gross average in 2015, just 0.05 under the top mark. The first-team AP All-American and All-Pac-12 pick planted 28 of his 61 kicks inside the 20-yard line, and forced 21 fair catches in his final year. His junior year was equally spectacular, as he received consensus All-American status averaging 46.7 per kick, and led the nation with 36 punts inside the 20 (36) and inside the 10 (19). Hackett had been pretty good in his first year as the full-time punter as well, earning first-team All-Pac-12 honors (43.4 average, 27 inside the 20, 19 fair catches).	Landed 45.9 percent of his punts inside the 20-yard line. Two time winner of the Ray Guy award. Base punts for touch and can land a flat bouncing punt inside the five. Finished with 22 percent of his punts inside the 10-yard line. Produced consistent results at Utah and is beloved on team.	Primarily rugby style punter with limited exposure as base punter. Scouts unable to get accurate hang time from him because of his punting style. Is a little slow with his snap-to-­punt time.	\N	Amongst the influx of Australian kickers into college football, Hackett is the lead dog. Hackett is competitive and confident and has shown the potential to succeed as a base punter, but his combine performance will be extremely important in his attempt to convince NFL general managers and special teams coaches that he can transition away from the rugby style with success.	\N	80	5.09999999999999964	tom-hackett	\N
2555560	Marshall	Koehn	18	73	197	9.5	Koehn (pronounced CANE) was more than a kicker playing for a four-time state champion in Solon, Iowa. He was a receiver (22-298, two TD) and defensive back (seven INT) as well as using his big leg to pound the ball through the uprights (and through the end zone on most kickoffs). He also excelled at soccer and baseball (winning two state titles there, as well), while lettering twice in wrestling (an Iowa high school athletic staple). Koehn walked on to the Hawkeyes, and then waited for three years (redshirting 2011) to get this chance before breaking through in 2014, converting 12-of-16 field goal attempts (with a long of 52 yards) and all 38 extra point tries. Koehn improved his field goal conversion rate as a senior (16-20, 80 percent) and made 47-of-53 point-afters while making his only attempt from 50-plus yards out (57) in a second-team All-Big Ten season. His leg strength was especially evident on kickoffs, as he forced touchbacks on an impressive 63 percent of his kickoffs during the past two years.	Nailed a 57-­yard field goal at the gun to defeat Pitt in Week 3. Made 12-of-15 from 40 yards and beyond at Iowa. Has enough leg to kick long attempts with desired trajectory. Never had a kickoff go out of bounds in 147 tries. Athletic and willing to tackle.	Inconsistent kickoff depth allowing too many returns. Tends to work ball from right to left like a golf shot. Tied for national lead with six missed extra points in 2015. Including extra points, missed some chip shots where it appeared to become mental.	\N	While the game-­winning 57-yarder looks good on the resume, Koehn doesn't have many 50-plus attempts under his belt and he doesn?t appear to possess the leg strength for kickoffs that NFL teams like. While he strikes the ball consistently and with good trajectory, special teams coaches will be concerned about those missed extra points.	\N	32	4.75	marshall-koehn	\N
2555561	Nick	O'Toole	19	75	219	9.75	Specialists are often known for being a bit eccentric, and O'Toole lives up to that description. His big leg and handlebar mustache earned him the nickname "Boomstache" early in his WVU career, and his long beard in the Duck Dynasty mold eventually received just as much attention. But his punting skills are what NFL scouts care about, as they look for the next NFL punter coming out of Morgantown (Todd Sauerbrun, Pat McAfee). O?Toole went to Fullerton College for one year out of high school, then transferred to WVU where he quickly established himself among the top punters in the nation with a second-team All-Big 12 performance in 2013 (44.1 gross average, 22 punts inside the 20 yard-line, 23 fair catches forced). His punting average dropped in 2014 to 41.8 yards per punt, but that was more a function of his kicks not reaching the end zone (24 of 57 punts inside the 20, just two touchbacks, along with 21 fair catches) than anything else. O'Toole finished in the top ten nationally in gross average as a senior (45.4) while receiving first-team All-Big 12 accolades. His touchback total increased quite a bit (15) but he still placed 25 of 71 kicks inside the 20 and forced 18 fair catches.	Big punter with good athleticism. Ran for fake punt first down on fourth-and-12. Base punter who averaged 45.1 yards per punt with a quality hang time of 4.06 seconds in 2015. Posted quick snap­-to-­punt time in every year he punted. Only had two games all season without a punt of at least 51 yards. Has a sweet nickname (was "Boomstache" in 2014 and "Boombeard" in 2015).	Had three punts returned for touchdowns in 2014. Had surprising issues with accuracy and touch this season. Saw his touchback total jump from 3 percent last season to almost 21 percent this year.	\N	\N	\N	29	5.12000000000000011	nick-otoole	\N
2555562	Mike	Thomas	4	73	200	\N	\N	Plays like his hair is on fire. Posted eye­-opening production in 2015. Motor is always in the red and brings enthusiasm and urgency to the field. Has good size, but plays even bigger. Able to play through contact and still make difficult, contested catches. Confidence took off as season progressed. Doesn't have blazing speed but hit explosive play after explosive play. Good leaper with great body control to win high percentage of 50-50 balls. Good hand fighter down the sideline. Will drain every yard he can get out of every catch.	Average athlete inside first 10 yards. Hip tightness limits sink into and out of breaks and routes can be very raw. JUCO transfer who played just two years of FBS football. Easy target to tag for press corners. Needs to vary approach and tempo of press release. Drop rate of 10.1 percent due to focus issues. Struggles creating separation at top of his routes versus tight man coverage. Needs more commitment as run blocker.	\N	While much of Thomas' production was churned out against middling competition, it is worth noting that he had at least one touchdown catch over his last 10 games including two touchdowns and 190 receiving yards in his bowl game against Washington. Thomas could face a struggle to get open against NFL press coverage, but his desire and competitiveness will make following his run in camp an interesting one.	"You want to write him off when you start watching the tape and then he just starts outworking everyone for the big plays." -- NFL South scout	62	4.99000000000000021	mike-thomas	\N

55	lfallo1	134943		89			4	1
56	lfallo1	129189	Burner, long, can return kicks. more of a strider but shows good quickness. raw... doesn't get as much separation as you'd expect from a guy with his speed / quickness combo....  Lit up the combine, so 3rd round seems far fetched.  Still don't think he's worth a 1st or 2nd rounder, but would def take after that	79			5	3

111	lfallo1	141896	Beast mode, great hands. man child that toys with smaller CBs	86			5	1
50	lfallo1	134318	technician that plays with a mean streak. many project him at guard, but see him as a day one starter at RT or either guard position.	90			4	1
77	lfallo1	126868	athletic, physical db. great vs the run & loves to hit. showed decent ball skills & has excellent speed, but coverage not his specialty.... worth a flyer given his traits.	71			4	4
63	lfallo1	134946	I think this kid could be a bigtime playmaker.  Only 5'11, but he is quick as ****.  His start / stop is incredible, and plays with elite top end speed.  If a team is trying to get faster, take a look.	75	speedster, incredibly quick.  playmaker with ball in hands, elusive. good separation, good burst off line.... returns kicks / punts... he is quicker / more athletic than you in the open space.	small, fragile, off field issues led to suspended all of 2017.	4	3
58	lfallo1	128306	tape shows a good athlete, long arms - locks onto dlineman. gets to second level.... terrible combine	70			4	4
64	lfallo1	134335	only watched four plays of this guy - memphis game.... 1) took a forearm to the chest & stunned back two yards, 2) whiffs on DL's hands, 3) good second level block, 4) whiffs on block completely........ fantastic combine, but failing to see physicality.	65			2	4
61	lfallo1	134770		94			5	1
78	lfallo1	126914	thin frame, but smooth corner. fluid hips, can turn and run. locates ball. willing cb in run support - that will throw his body into tackles.  not great height, but overall is a well rounded corner.	77			5	3
59	lfallo1	128328	decent athlete, mean mean mean streak. good punch.... i dunno, kinda reminds of ryan jensen - not sure if that's a good thing	61			3	5

62	lfallo1	518763		90			3	1
71	lfallo1	134671	he looks like larry czonka.  drags defenderss and just plays like a freight train. deciptively quick... none of it looks right	67			3	4
75	lfallo1	134775	brother of 1st rounder Tremaine Edmunds. athletic safety with thick build. shows speed to cover cross, good tackler. breaks down well in open field. showed pretty good ball skills and has speed to run with receivers. as is the case with many safeties, shows stiff hips. much more comfortable playing downhill. watched him take the bate on double moves too often.	67			3	4
74	lfallo1	128886	downhill safety that will light you up. film is littered with highlight reel hits.  wraps up...  long / rangy build... stiff hips, not great in coverage.	54			3	7
69	lfallo1	127194	dangerous pass-rusher off the edge. exp in 3-4 & 4-3. delivered some violent sacks... only started playing football as a senior in HS. after a good 2016 season, production fell off in 2017... talent wise, could be a nice situational rusher.	64			4	5
40	lfallo1	134980	physical wideout with good size. was uncoverable at times at MD. suffered from poor QB play due to barrage of injuries at position.	90	YAC, extremely physical and works for extra yards. fights for the ball, hand catcher.  rangy	TBD	5	1
110	lfallo1	133162		75			3	3
109	lfallo1	126895	incredibly quick, good straight line speed. mirrors wrs tremendously, doesn't panic with ball in the air & comfortably tracks ball. very productive.... size is an issue.	78			5	3
112	lfallo1	141158	More to come.  But in short, he is monstrously good & easily a top 5 talent.	91			5	1

13	lfallo1	124927	freakish, small school... raw, strong, athletic. caught 340lb tackle with right hook n knocked him out the way. prospect player with upside. good punch, moves OTs, tough time sitting and making open field tackles	67	\N	\N	3	4
21	lfallo1	125635	GREAT hands, good body control, crisp routes, massive catch radius, creates separation. chad johnson-esque, attacks ball	67	\N	\N	3	4

49	lfallo1	134314	mammoth tackle that struggles in space, but has the ability to collapse entire sides of dlines.  right tackle	88	mauler, long arms, good initial punch & first step. has a mean streak	slow feet at times, has trouble with speed	4	1

46	lfallo1	127678		64			5	5
33	lfallo1	124919	Redshirted in 2013 before finding his way into the defensive line rotation in 2014... Was rated as the No. 8 overall prospect in North Carolina, the No. 11 weakside DE nationally, and a four-star prospect (90 rating) by 247Sports... Enrolled at Ohio State in the winter of 2013... Was an all-state selection as a senior after putting up a 13-sack campaign... Had 12 sacks and 63 tackles as a high school junior.	81			3	2
72	lfallo1	128079		82	jacob guy		4	2
57	lfallo1	134945	sleeper?? physical wr with good hands. catches in traffic, great YAC	85			4	2
39	lfallo1	129114	smallish wideout with fantastic quickness and great hands. incredibly explosive off snap and is electric in space.	89	quick with a burst, explosive separation and attacks ball. hand catcher exceptionally quick	size, school / competition. willing but ineffective blocker.	4	1
60	lfallo1	516328	He doesn't want to block you - as much as bury you in the ground.... he is the meanest linemen i've ever seen.... off field issues chased him out of Texas, where he had once been a very highly touted prospect... he is raw and undisciplined, but also an incredibly strong, athletic, and angry freak of nature.	64			5	5
73	lfallo1	128817	human highlight reel of huge hits	64			4	5
66	lfallo1	368356	physical, good body control, good yac. playmaker, attacks ball with hands... struggles at time to beat the jam, telegraphs routes	80			3	2
19	lfallo1	124813	Interchangeable safety with a sheriff's mentality. Adams is a physical tone-setter who should thrive near the line of scrimmage or in a robber role. Should be a commanding presence in the locker room early on and his do-as-I-do play demeanor could be the catalyst for turning a struggling defense around quickly.	90	Natural-born leader of men. Well-built. Will not hesitate for one second as a hitter. Steps downhill looking to punish running backs to set a tone for defense. Toggles between patient and urgent in treks to the ball. Plays off blockers. Approaches target with open arms and wide, balanced base to limit escape routes. Intelligent field general. Gets secondary aligned properly. Plays with plus balance in coverage. Pattern reader who can digest combinations. Alert for misdirection keys from offense. Party crasher on screen plays. Can handle coverage responsibilities against tight ends.\n\nFive interceptions and two recovered fumbles over last two seasons at LSU. Special-teams terror as freshman and sophomore, notching 21 tackles. No penalties in 2016. Father, George, was a first-round pick of the Giants in 1984.	Handsy and too willing to clamp onto receivers down the field. Hard-charging downhill, but a little stiff when asked to retreat. Long speed appears to be average on tape. Eyes drop when targets approach his area. Anticipation is average, limiting his range as a center-fielder. Will give away some interceptions due to drops.\n\nSlower coming to balance as tackler on bursting runners between the tackles. Desire to limit cutbacks leads to challenging play-side tackles. Doesn't pursue with expected vigor from across the field. Aggressiveness opens him up against play-action.	5	1
36	lfallo1	129068	Bid body, physical speed, hands... weird number	90			4	1
26	lfallo1	125473	small back with good cuts, upper body power... caught WR-esque seem routes at SD state. versatile player.... not a 3 down back, dunno if he can block. mid rounder, but love the versatility	67	\N	\N	3	4
28	lfallo1	125220	jake likes him... that's all i know	67	\N	\N	3	4
29	lfallo1	162514	his name is fucking ironhead gallon	67	\N	\N	3	4
81	lfallo1	127574	rangy, long, decent size. stiff, not incredibly physical.  might be better suited at safety.	55			2	6
86	lfallo1	498722	need to watch more... initial thoughts are limited athlete with good leg drive, anchor, and decent bend. more than held his own against Bama front in 2017.	75			3	3
82	lfallo1	126930	quick feet / mirrors receiver, fluid hips. good hands at line, redirects. locates ball. solid run defender that can close. battles for the 50/50 ball... intrigued.	76			4	3
84	lfallo1	133176		88			4	1
53	lfallo1	128304	Struggled against Miami (as did everyone on that line)... but a bad look.  struggled with speed rushers as sr.	88			3	1

42	lfallo1	127159		93			4	1
76	lfallo1	128859	small school kid that excelled at the FCS level. Spent time as a Safety (fr), Linebacker (2016 all conference), and Cornerback (2017 all conference).  Excellent physicality on WRs at line - and completely overmatched WRs. good ball skills. fluid hips.... big time, explosive hitter..... obviously competition is a huge concern. did okay at combine. 4.5 40, 4.28 20, 40 inch vert	68			4	4
79	lfallo1	517527		59			4	6
80	lfallo1	126870	pretty good tackler, good physicality when lined up in press using hands to redirect & ride wideouts.  showed good slot covg. completely whiffs at times in press, doesn't have the speed to make it up.  not a premier athlete, under six foot.  his physicality will get him in trouble in the nfl. doesn't locate the ball well.	60			2	5
85	lfallo1	128820		75			3	3
87	lfallo1	128305		77			5	3
83	lfallo1	373532	very athletic, quick feet, good bend.  has the length / range you'd like. willing player that transitioned from TE to OT.  as a late 2nd or 3rd rounder? yes... but i just hesitate to draft a 1st round tackle that was a TE until a couple yrs ago & currently lacks strength.  his technique still needs work, he needs to bulk up & could have a roughening up period against NFL DE's.  You'd be drafting potential.	79			4	2
65	lfallo1	128594	smooth runner with good vision. good receiver out of backfield, and willing pass blocker.  3-down back, but his lack of physicality makes me hesitant. 2nd or 3rd rounder.	75	smooth runner, good vision / patience. big / thick build. willing & capable pass blocker. smooth / natural receiver out of backfield.	for his size, doesn't show consistent power. often goes down on first contact. not a burner. 20-yard-shuttle doesn't match what shows on tape.	3	3
52	lfallo1	133939	Dominant run blocker, good hands, good in pass pro.  best guard in draft.  Struggled against Miami (as did everyone on that line)... but it upset me. Don't see him as the 15 time all-pro guard he's being hyped as.	90			4	1
44	lfallo1	128956		86			4	2
1	lfallo1	134947	Physical WR bohemoth with speed & hands and something...	88	\N	\N	4	2
67	lfallo1	135148	smallish wideout with a thick frame. quick, sudden to the ball and quick to adjust.  not overly athletic, but shows good hands & body control, savy route runner... caught the pass from rosen on the "fake spike" play against texas a&m	57			3	6
113	lfallo1	133116	TBD	75			3	3
68	lfallo1	128485	I believe i like this guy.  smart qb that understands defenses & is quick through his progressions. good release & good pocket presence in terms of sliding.  Has some heavy feet, but still moves well in the pocket. instinctively moves defenders with his eyes & pump fakes. good ball placement & can throw from different angles & speeds. keeps eyes down field when outside pocket.... Not incredibly mobile and despite making the right decision (i.e., step up, slide in the pocket), often doesn't do this quick enough and gets himself in trouble - cause for a fumbling issue.  Had happy feet in 2017 & made some inexcusable throws with pressure in his face.... overall, I like him & could be worth a flyer in the 3rd or 4th	68	smart, reads defenses well. rolls through progressions naturally. keeps eyes downfield with busy pocket.  squares body when throwing outside pocket. accurate throwing outside pocket. throws from different angles / speeds. film junkie that understands the game, and eyes light up when talking about X's and O's. live arm... was a baseball pitcher that throws in the 90s	fumbling issue as senior. holds onto ball too long trying to make plays. gets happy feet in busy pocket, throws off back foot. made a couple horrendous throws with pressure in his face.  concerned about athleticism related to avoiding rush.  has a quick release, but it's a long motion.	4	4

93	lfallo1	134623		79			5	3
94	lfallo1	128089	speedy, good motor, good leverage. ability to close, good quickness and ability to turn hips and cover seam. good tackler despite the one hand.... undersized, gets washed out. not a lot of strength at POA.	68			3	4
95	lfallo1	128064		61			2	5
88	lfallo1	127636	closing speed, nasty... fluid hips, covers TE / slot.	90			5	1
96	lfallo1	373350		63			2	5
98	lfallo1	127872	dominant run blocker, long arms, quickly engages and neutralizes smaller dlineman. good leverage, turns defenders... very athletic for a 340 pounder... I don't want a guard at 16, but he will likely go somewhere in the first.	87			5	2
101	lfallo1	134211	strong tackler, closes and shows a burst. diagnoses plays and shows explosion to beat block to play... fades and loses ground, gets washed out.  not great lateral quickness.	81			3	2
104	lfallo1	128955	athletic, speedy pass catching TE... fantastic straight line speed, great vertical. good redzone threat that wins jump balls.  glides into and out of breaks - fails to get separating and telegraphs routes.  willing blocker, but gets out leveraged.... (former bball player with some crazy dunking ability)	85			3	2
103	lfallo1	134882	athletic tight end, with good YAC, speed, and playmaking ability... good quickness off line, excellent vertical threat down seam. good concentration. uses body well to wall off defenders... willing blocker, but far from a road grader.. but as a pass catching weapon is a legit 1st rounder, and day 1 weapon... former baseball pitcher FWIW.	89			5	1
102	lfallo1	134865	good length, uses body to wall off defenders. polished route runner that essentially played a slot position at OU. good hands.. not incredibly quick or sudden. doesn't have great playmaking ability after catch compared to other 1st/2nd round TEs	84			3	2
105	lfallo1	133946		82			3	2
106	lfallo1	127855	prototypical center, day 1 starter.... if he's healthy (torn pec at combine). want him in 2nd	88			5	2
